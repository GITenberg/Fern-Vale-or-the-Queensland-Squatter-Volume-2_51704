<p>"Those fellows have been up to some mischief
I am certain," said Tom when the blacks
departed, as described in the last chapter.
"I am confident my brother has not given
them anything; and if they have got any
rations at Strawberry Hill, they must have
stolen them. However, if you intend going
over to their corroboree, I'll accompany you."</p>

<p>"I do intend going," said John, "for I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
never seen them in such force as they'll be to-night,
and I am curious to see the effect. Do
you know what is the nature of the ceremony
of their kipper corroboree?"</p>

<p>"I can't exactly say," replied Tom, "their
ordinary corroborees are simply feasts to
commemorate some event; but the kipper
corroboree has some mystery attached to it,
which they do not permit strangers to witness.
I believe it is held once a year, to admit their
boys into the communion of men; and to
give 'gins' to the neophytes, if they desire to
add to their importance by assuming a
marital character. I believe it is simply a
ceremony, in which they recognise the
transition of their youths from infancy to
manhood; though they keep the proceedings
veiled from vulgar eyes."</p>

<p>"When, then," continued John, "the kippers
are constituted men, and get their gins, are
their marriage engagements of a permanent
nature; I mean does their nuptial ceremony,
whatever it may be, effectually couple them;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
and is it considered by them inviolable?"</p>

<p>"I believe," replied Tom, "the ceremony is
binding on the gins, but their lords are permitted
to exercise a supreme power over the
liberty and destiny of their spouses. The
gins are merely looked upon as so many
transferable animals, and they are frequently
stolen and carried off by adventurous lovers
from their lawful lords and masters; and as
frequently made over with the free consent of
their husbands, the same as we should do
with flocks and herds. Most of the quarrels
among the tribes arise from such thefts; and
the wills and inclinations of the gins are
never for a moment considered."</p>

<p>After this remark the conversation of the
young men turned into other channels. About
sundown they prepared themselves for their
visit, and mounting their horses started off to
the Gibson river; which, owing to the darkness
of the night, and the difficulty they experienced
in threading the bush, and avoiding
the fallen logs, they did not reach so quickly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
as they had anticipated. They, however,
crossed by the flats, and guided by the noise
of the blacks, and the light from their fires
in the scrub, they soon came upon the
"camp;" where they found Dugingi, true to
his promise, waiting for them.</p>

<p>The camp was composed of about fifty
"gunyas" or huts, formed in a circle; in the
midst of which were several of the natives,
talking and gesticulating most vociferously
and wildly. The gunyas were small conical
structures of about five or six feet in diameter;
formed by pieces of cane being fixed into the
ground in an arched shape, so as to make ribs,
which were covered with the flakey sheets of
the tea tree bark, and laid perfectly close and
compact, in which position they were fixed
by an outer net-work of reedy fibre; making,
though primitive and meagre in accommodation,
a dwelling perfectly impervious to the
weather. Into these burrow-like domiciles,
crowd, sometimes, as many as five or six
human beings, who coil themselves into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
mass to economize space, and generate caloric
in cold nights; when they have a fire in front
of the opening which serves for a door. In
warmer weather, however, they generally
stretch themselves under heaven, with only a
blanket to cover them; and, with their feet
towards the fire, a party may frequently be
seen radiating in a circle from the centre of
heat.</p>

<p>When the camp was approached by the
young men, the host of dogs, which are the
usual concomitants of a black's tribe, gave
warning of the visitors' presence; and Dugingi,
who was by that means attracted, first
removing their horses to a place of safety, led
them within the mysterious periphery. As
they emerged suddenly from the obscurity of
the scrub into the open space where the corroboree
was in full progress, they were not a
little startled at the scene before them. In
the centre was an immense fire; and around
it, about one hundred and fifty men were
assembled in a circle, except at a gap at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
side from which the visitors approached.
Here sat, or rather squatted, the gins, the
piccaninies, and the males incapacitated from
senescence or infirmities. The blacks having
ceased their exertions as our friends arrived,
the latter had a good opportunity of surveying
the picture at their leisure.</p>

<p>In the spot where the blacks had made
their camp the ground was naturally clear,
and was covered with a smooth sward; while
immediately beyond the circumscribed limits
of the natural clearance, the thick scrub was,
to any but a black fellow, perfectly impenetrable;
thus presenting to the eye of the
beholder, the appearance of an umbrageous
amphitheatre especially created for those
savage orgies. The men were all more or
less bedecked and besmeared; and, at the
moment of our friends' contemplation of
them, stood taking breath preparatory to the
repetition of fresh exertions. The immense
fire was being continually replenished by the
gins, and threw a fitful glance over the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
scene that struck the mind with an indescribable
sensation of mingled awe, dread, and
disgust. While those sensations were traversing
the minds of John and Tom Rainsfield
Jemmy Davis stepped forward from amidst
the group, and saluted them with the greatest
urbanity. But such was his metamorphosis
that our friends did not, until he had declared
himself by speech, recognise in the painted
savage before them an educated and civilized
black.</p>

<p>His hair was drawn up to a tuft on the top
of his head, and into it had been thrust numerous
of the most gaudy parrot and cockatoo
feathers. When he walked this top knot
acquired an eccentric oscillation, which gave
his head the appearance of a burlesque
on the plumed cranium of a dignified hearse
horse; and was the only part of his
ornature that was of a ludicrous character.
His forehead was painted a deep yellow;
from his eyes to a line parallel to his nose
his skin shone with a bright red; while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
rest of his face showed its natural dirty brown
colour. His body was fancifully marked in
white, delineating his ribs; with grotesque
devices on his breast and back. His legs
and arms were as black as charcoal could
make them; and with a necklace of bones and
shells, his toilet was complete. It has been
facetiously stated that the New Zealander's
full dress consists of a shirt collar and a pair
of spurs; but Jemmy Davis had no such useless
appendages; and, as he stood before his
guests in the conviction of his costume being
complete, and in the pride of conscious adornment,
he never dreamt but that his own
self-gratulation was also shadowing their
admiration and delight.</p>

<p>In a few minutes John and his companion
were left alone; and the corroboree commenced
afresh by the resumption of the
musical accompaniments, which, as they were
peculiar, we may as well describe. We have
already said, the gins were squatted on the
ground near the circle; and, we may now
add, they had composed their ungraceful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
forms in the oriental fashion. Some of them
had their hands half open, or rather their
fingers were kept close together, while the
palms were made to assume a concave shape,
as if for the purpose of holding water. With
them in this form they struck them simultaneously
on their supine thighs, with a
metrical regularity, which made an unearthly
hollow noise, and formed the base of their
orchestral display. Others of them beat a
similar measure on their waddies, or sticks;
while the whole burst into a discordant vocal
accompaniment, in which they were joined
by the men and piccaninies in a dull and
monotonous cadence. This was their song;
which, to adequately describe, would be impossible.
Some idea, however, may possibly
be formed of it, when we say that they all
commenced in a high mournful key, in which
they unintelligibly mumbled their bucolic.
On this first note they dwelt for about half a
minute; and descended the gamut in the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
metre, resting only on the flats, and expending
their breath in a prolongation of the last, and
deepest, note they could utter; terminating in
one eructation something between a grunt and
a sigh, or a concentration of the idiosyncratic
articulation of the London paviers. And as
they dwelt upon this note for about a minute,
the combined effects of their mutterings, and
the noise of their feet, were not unlike the
distant fulmination of thunder.</p>

<p>Their dance too, was conducted totally
different to the wild gestures of other savages.
The participators in the ceremony, as we have
already explained, stood in a semi-circular
line. Slightly stooping, they swung their
arms backwards and forwards before their
bodies, and with their feet beat a measured
tread on the ground; while they continued
to contract their frames, almost into a sitting
posture, and to accelerate their pendulous
and stamping motions; until, with an universal
convulsion, the last sigh or grunt was expatriated
from their carcasses. After a dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
stop of some few seconds, with a recommencement
of their femoral accompaniment, they
erected their bodies with their voices, and
proceeded <i>de capo</i>; presenting a scene more
like a festival in pandemonium than a congregation
of human beings in "this huge
rotundity on which we tread."</p>

<p>The feelings of the young men, as they stood
and watched this performance, were varied;
neither of them had seen a corroboree on so
grand a scale before; and they were for a
time lost in wonder at an exhibition, which
no description can truthfully depict. John
was dreaming of the emancipation and improvement
of a race, which he believed, could
be made to ameliorate their condition; and
felt sorrowful that, in the midst of civilisation
(with its examples before their eyes, and the
inculcations which had been instilled into the
nature of one of their number), the blacks
should be still perpetuating the emblems of
their barbarity and degradation. Tom's
meditations were of a different nature;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
though he advocated kind treatment to them
in the intercourses of life, he still believed
them an inferior race of sentient beings; if
not altogether devoid of the mental attributes
of man. He, moreover, thought he read in
their manner, despite all the suavity of Jemmy
Davis and Dugingi, something that portended
evil; and fancied he heard more than once,
his own name uttered by them in their song.
It might have been only fancy, he thought;
but an idea of something premeditated had
seized upon his mind, and he could not divest
himself of it.</p>

<p>Our young friends by this time, having seen
quite enough to satisfy them, and being unnoticed
in their position, quietly left the spot;
and, having procured their horses, retraced
their steps to the river. They there mounted,
and having crossed the stream, returned almost
silently to Fern Vale, and retired to rest.
On the following morning Tom took his leave
of his friend; while, almost contemporary with
his departure, John's black boys, Billy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
Jemmy, presented themselves to resume their
former life on the station. We may remark
that Billy had by this time perfectly recovered
from his castigation, though he, and also his
companion, did not fail to stigmatize in very
strong, if not in very elegant, or pure English,
phraseology, the conduct of Mr. Rainsfield;
and as much as insinuated that the tribe were
in no very friendly way disposed towards
him.</p>

<p>This, John Ferguson was seriously grieved
to learn; for he dreaded the consequence of an
open rupture between the aborigines and his
neighbour. He knew, if the blacks became
more than ordinarily troublesome, that Rainsfield
would enlist the sympathies of his friends,
and his class generally; when blood would
inevitably be shed, and the poor natives
hunted from the face of the earth. He therefore
determined, if he should not see Tom in
a day or two, to ride over and call upon Mr.
Rainsfield; and while adverting to the treatment
received by his black boy from him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
warn him of the danger, not only to himself,
but to all the settlers in his neighbourhood,
by his persisting in his stringent course.
With this intention, a few days after the
corroboree, not having seen his friend in
the interval, he rode over to Strawberry
Hill.</p>

<p>As he approached the residence of the
Rainsfields, despite his struggles to suppress
it, he felt his heart beat high with the anticipation
of seeing Eleanor, for the first time
since his meeting with Bob Smithers. John
had, of late, striven hard to wean himself
from what he attempted to believe was
his wild infatuation; and thought that he
had sufficiently schooled his mind, so as to
meet her without the slightest perturbation.
But he had deceived himself; and as he
approached the house, and felt a consciousness
of her proximity, he experienced that
strange agitation over which mortals have no
control. He, however, determined to avoid
giving any outward indication of his mental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
disquietude, so as not to cause any uneasiness
to Eleanor from his visit; and for that purpose
he stopped his horse in the bush, before he
came within sight, and collected himself into
a settled calmness. Having performed this
little piece of training he proceeded, and was
passing the huts on his way to the house,
when he was accosted by Mr. Billing; who
informed him that Mr. Rainsfield had desired
him to intimate, that if he, Mr. Ferguson,
desired to see that gentleman, he would meet
him at Mr. Billing's cottage in a few minutes.
This request John thought rather singular;
but he turned his horse's head to the direction
of the cottage, at the door of which he
alighted; and, after fastening his horse to the
fence, he entered.</p>

<p>"You will no doubt think it exceedingly
rude in me, Mr. Ferguson," exclaimed the little
man, "to intercept you in your road to the
house. Though you perceive me, sir, in a menial
capacity, I am perfectly conversant with, as I
am also possessed of the feelings of a gentleman;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
therefore I feel a repugnance, sir, in
wounding those feelings in another. You
are doubtless aware, sir, we have had another
marauding visitation from those insolent
savages; and Mr. Rainsfield is not only
greatly enraged at them, but has become,
sir, extremely irascible and truculent towards
myself; and has conceived a notion that you
are in some way influencing and encouraging
them in their depredations. The pertinacity
with which they annoy him, sir, is certainly
marvellous; and he is confirmed in the belief
that it is in a great measure owing to your
instigations; therefore he gave instructions
that, in the event of your calling, I should
request you to step under my humble roof,
while I sent him notice of your presence.
This, sir, I have done, so you may expect to
see him in a few minutes. I merely mention
these circumstances, sir, not in disparagement
of my employer; but to account to you for
my rudeness, and exonerate myself from the
imputation of any voluntary violation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
good breeding."</p>

<p>"Pray, don't mention it, Mr. Billing," replied
John; "I don't imagine for a moment that
you would intentionally commit any breach
of decorum, even if the interruption of my
passage could be termed such; but I must
confess, I can't understand why Mr. Rainsfield
should wish to prevent me from calling upon
him in his own house." Though John said
this, his heart whispered a motive for such
interruption.</p>

<p>"I am flattered, sir, by your good opinion,"
said Mr. Billing, "and I thank you. I believe,
sir, you're a native of the colony, and have not
visited Europe; but you are a man of the
world, sir, I can perceive, and will readily
understand the anomalies of my position. I,
who have been bred, sir, in the mercantile
community of the cosmopolitan metropolis,
being subjected to the petty tyrannies of a
man, whom I consider mentally my inferior. I
am disgusted, sir, with the incongruities of my
situation, and harassed by the thought of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
my trials being shared by Mrs. Billing (who,
I assure you, sir, is an ornament to her sex);
and the total absence, sir, of all those comforts,
which a man who has been in the
position I have been in, sir, and who has come
to my years, naturally expects, tends to make
this occupation distasteful to me."</p>

<p>John, we are ashamed to say (at the moment
forgetful of his own) felt amused at the
sorrows of the little man; though he smilingly
assured him that he thought a man of his evident
abilities was thrown away in the bush,
and that he believed it would be considerably
more to his advantage, if he forsook so inhospitable
a pursuit, as that in which he was
engaged, for something more congenial to his
nature and compatible with his education.</p>

<p>"My dear sir," replied the enthusiastic
storekeeper, "I again thank you. I perceive,
sir, by your judicious remarks, you are a gentleman
of no ordinary discernment. The same
idea has often struck me, sir; in fact, I may
say the 'wish is father to the thought;' but,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
unfortunately, 'thereby hangs a tale.' If you
have no objection to listen to me, sir, for a
few minutes, I will explain the peculiarities
of my position."</p>

<p>John having expressed himself desirous of
hearing the explanation, Mr. Billing proceeded.
"You must know, sir, that after
finishing a sound general education at one
of the public schools of London (you will forgive
me, sir, for commencing at the normal
period of my career), my father, who was a
medical man of good practice but large family,
sent me, sir, to the desk. I, in fact, entered
the counting-house of my relatives, Messrs.
Billing, Barlow, &amp; Co., of Upper Thames
Street, in the city of London, a firm extensively
engaged in the comb and brush line,
and enjoying a wide celebrity, sir, in the city
and provinces. I continued at my post, sir,
for years, until I obtained the situation of
provincial traveller, which place I continued
to fill for a lengthy period. I need hardly
say, sir, that in my peregrinations my name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
was sufficient to command respect from our
friends and constituents, who naturally imagined
that I must have been a partner in
the firm I represented; consequently, sir, my
vicissitudes were almost imaginary, and my
comfort superior to the generality of commercial
travellers. I did not, of course, sir, enlighten
the minds of our constituents on their
error, the effects of which I every day enjoyed;
more especially as the firm, from my
long services, had solemnly pledged themselves
to receive me into their corporate body
as a partner. The mutations of even our
nearest relatives, sir, are not to be depended
upon; for I found in my experience, that the
word of a principal is not always a guarantee.
Upon urging the recognition of my claims, I
found a spirit of equivocation to exist in my
friends; and such conduct not agreeing, sir,
with my views of integrity, I uttered some
severe strictures on their scandalous behaviour,
and withdrew, sir, from the connexion.</p>

<p>"I must remark, sir, that about three years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
before this event (ah, sir! that was a soft
period of my life), I took unto myself an accomplished
lady as the wife of my bosom. I
had been at great pains and expense, sir, to
consolidate our comfort in a nice little box at
Brixton; and had been blessed, sir, with two
of our dear children. About this time the
fame of the Australian <i>El Dorado</i> had spread
far and wide; and, after my rupture with
my relatives, I was easily allured, sir, from
my peaceful hearth to seek my fortune in
this land of promise; I say a land of promise,
sir, but I impugn not its fair name when
I add that if it ever was one to me, it
failed to fulfil its obligations. I fear, sir, I
am tedious," said Mr. Billing, breaking off
in his discourse, "for this is a theme I feel
I can dilate on;" but being assured by his
companion that he was by no means tiresome,
he continued: "I told you, sir, that I had
taken great pains and expense to furnish my
house at Brixton; and I felt a reluctance to
submit it to the hammer, and to sever myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
and family from the blissful fireside of our
English home. However, sir, avarice is strong
in the minds of mortals; and visions of antipodean
wealth decided my fate, and caused the
sacrifice of my contented home on the altar of
Plutus. I had heard that the difficulties of the
diggings were insuperable to genteel aspirants
after gold; and I, therefore, determined, sir,
to be wise in my own generation, and, instead
of digging for the precious metal, to open an
establishment where I could procure it, sir, by
vending articles of every-day use. For this
purpose, sir, I invested my capital in stock of
which I had had practical experience, that is,
in combs and brushes; conjecturing, sir, that
they would be articles which most speculators
would overlook, and, consequently, be in great
demand. In due time, sir, I arrived in the
colony with my goods, and lost not a moment
unnecessarily in repairing to the diggings. I
need not recount, sir, the many difficulties
which beset my path; I believe they were
common to all in similar circumstances; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
you, are no doubt, sir, sufficiently acquainted
with such scenes yourself. Suffice it to say,
sir, that eventually I reached my destination,
and discovered, as we would say in mercantile
parlance, that my goods had arrived to a bad
market. I assure, you, sir, the horrid creatures
who congregated at those diggings, notwithstanding
that their heads were perfect masses
of hair, disdained, yes, absolutely disdained,
sir, the use of my wares.</p>

<p>"I then asked myself what was to be done;
and while meditating on a reply, sir, a viper
was at hand to tempt me to my ruin. A
plausible, well-spoken gentleman, sir, introduced
himself to me as a Mr. Black; and
proposed that as my goods were of no value
on the diggings, but were very saleable in
Melbourne, I should take them back and commence
business there. He at the same time
remarked, sir, that to commence business it
would be essential for me to have 'colonial
experience;' and doubting if I possessed such
an acquirement, he, therefore, begged, sir, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
offer his services. He, in fact proposed that
he should join me in the undertaking; stating,
sir, that through his general knowledge of
business, he was convinced that the speculation
would succeed; and suggested that we
should at once proceed to Melbourne, sir,
with my goods. He would embark, he said,
his capital in the concern, and purchase an
assortment of goods for a general business,
which we were to carry on under the name
and style of 'Black and Billing.' This he
facetiously made the subject of a witticism,
by remarking that it would be rendered into
'Black Billy'<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> by the diggers when they
visited town; and would of a certainty
ensure our success. I must confess, sir, I was
taken in by the scoundrel's wiles, and readily
entered into his scheme; the result of which
is easily related. With the expense of carrying
my goods and myself backwards and forwards
from the diggings, my spare cash was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
all but expended; and when, sir, I rejoined
Mrs. Billing, whom I had left behind me, sir,
in Melbourne, until I should have become
settled, I found myself almost penniless.
However, sir, although I'm a man of small
stature, I am possessed of considerable energy
and, therefore, sir, set myself earnestly to
work. I soon procured a shop, though with
miserable accommodation, and at an enormous
rental; but my partner assured me it was no
matter, as we would soon reap our harvest. I
got my goods, sir, into the place, and shortly
afterwards my partner procured an extensive
assortment also; when we commenced our
business, as I thought, under very favourable
auspices. But I soon discovered my mistake;
for one fine morning I found Mr. Black had decamped
with all the money of the concern, after
converting as many of the goods into gold as
he could. I then discovered, sir, that the stock
he had procured was upon credit, on the
strength of that which I had in the place at
the time; and finding his defalcations were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
greater than I could possibly meet, and my
creditors being fearful that I would follow
his example, I was compelled to relinquish
my property to liquidate their claims. I
then, sir, found myself not only destitute, but
homeless; with my wife and children dependent
upon me for their subsistence.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a>
A name applied by the diggers to the tin pot in which they
boil their water, as also to black hats.</p></div>

<p>"I managed, sir, however, to procure employment
by driving a cart; and, after saving
sufficient money, succeeded in getting round
to Sydney, where my wife, sir, had relations.
They, sir, promised me assistance, and after a
short interval fulfilled their promise by establishing
me in a store at Armidale; where I got
on, sir, pretty well, and would have succeeded,
but for the chicanery of some scoundrels,
sir, by whom I lost considerably, and was a
second time reduced to labour for a support.
Through various vicissitudes, sir, I have come
to this, and, you may well imagine, that a
man of my sensitive feeling and appreciation
of honour, in this menial capacity meets with
nothing but disgust and mortification. But,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
sir, I do not repine; however dark is the
horizon of my fate, despair does not enter my
mind; the clouds of depression must necessarily
some day be removed; and then, sir, the
sun of my future will burst forth with a
refulgence, the more resplendent from its
previous concealment. I desire, sir, in fact
it is the fondest wish of my heart, to return to
Old England; but at present that cannot be,
for means, sir, are wanting; the all potent
needful is required; money, sir. But things
must improve, they cannot last for ever thus;
to think that I, a gentleman, and Mrs. Billing
a gentlewoman, should waste our very
existence, sir, in this wilderness; banished,
sir, from the very intercourse of man; expatriated,
sir, from all we hold most dear, and,
forsaken, sir, by the society whence we are
ostracized. The thought, sir, is harrowing;
yes, sir, harrowing beyond measure."</p>

<p>Mr. Billing was now getting pathetic and
rather lachrymose; and his confessions might
have become of a confidential, and a painful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
nature, had they not, very much to the relief
of our hero, been cut short by the opportune entrance
of Mr. Rainsfield, who, when Mr. Billing
had left the room, addressed himself to John:</p>

<p>"I must apologize for keeping you waiting,
Mr. Ferguson, but I was engaged at the
moment I heard of your call; and I thought
by your meeting me here it would save you
from that pain which, otherwise, your visit
might have occasioned you, after the circumstances
which transpired when you last
favoured us with your company."</p>

<p>"I am particularly indebted to you for
your solicitation," replied John; "but I may
remark, I had sufficient confidence in myself
to feel assured that I would have neither
received, nor given any pain in the manner in
which I presume you mean. And I may also
state that, but for the desire I had to give
you some information that may be of vital
importance to you, I would have disdained
your bidding."</p>

<p>"Then, may I beg to know the object of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
your call," enquired Rainsfield.</p>

<p>"I have two," replied John, "first I have
been informed by one of my black boys that
you severely maltreated him; and considering
myself aggrieved by the act, as it was the
means of depriving me of his services, I beg
you to explain the cause for so unwarrantable
a procedure."</p>

<p>"I justify my acts to no man," exclaimed
Rainsfield, "and recognise no blacks as others
than members of their general community;
who take upon themselves to perform various
acts of aggression. The laws of our country
not being potent enough to protect us from
their marauding, we do it ourselves; and if
you think fit to gainsay our right, you know
what course to pursue; and now, sir, for your
second object."</p>

<p>"I might with equal justice," said John,
"decline to afford you the information I by
accident obtained, but I have no desire to
show such churlishness, and I believe that by
judiciously acting upon it, you may save<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
yourself from some calamity; which I have
good cause to believe is impending. My two
black boys who left me after your assault on
one of them, and who were only persuaded to
return after their great corroboree by my
conciliating their chief, have informed me, in
an imperfect manner, that some overt act of
aggression, on the part of the tribe, is meditated;
and it is to put you on your guard
against this that I have ventured to trouble
you with my presence."</p>

<p>"Then it was at that corroboree on the
spoliation of my property that you heard
this?" exclaimed Rainsfield. "My goods were
purloined to feast those imps of darkness, and
you lent your presence to grace their proceedings?
I always thought you encouraged the
villains in their infamies, and I now perceive
my suspicions were well founded. However,
sir, I am perfectly independent of you, and
your so called information. I have decided
upon my course of action, and will not therefore
trouble you further to interest yourself in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
behalf. You will no doubt readily perceive
that your presence here at any time would be
extremely unpleasant; and I must therefore
request that you absent yourself from my
house as much as possible. I shall now wish
you good day;" saying which Rainsfield
quitted the room.</p>

<p>John Ferguson was so taken by surprise
at the violent tirade he had just listened to,
that he had had no idea of defending himself
from an accusation, the manifest absurdity of
which merely struck him as contemptuous.
But he felt a source of grief at being summarily
estranged from the other members of
the family; and whatever his feelings had
been when he came to the station, he left it
with a heavy heart, and returned home to
meet the cavalcade, which we have seen in a
previous chapter had gone over.</p>

</div>

<p>Despite his professed contempt for John
Ferguson's information Mr. Rainsfield felt an
uneasy apprehension at the growing confidence,
and contumacious freedom of the
blacks. He even began to doubt if he would
be able to maintain his position single-handed
against them, and thought seriously of the
advisableness of calling a meeting of the
surrounding settlers, to organize a league for
their mutual protection. But then he remembered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
the blacks directed all their
<i>animus</i> against himself, and it was therefore
questionable, he imagined, if he could induce
more than two or three of his neighbours
to join him; besides which, even they could
not constantly be on the alert; while he must,
consequently, be frequently open to surprisal.
A thought, however, struck him, or rather we
should have said, a diabolical idea suggested
itself to his mind; and, after cogitating and
arguing with himself for some time, he determined
to act upon it.</p>

<p>The pestilence, so he mentally soliloquized,
had now reached its height, and something
must be done; for he was not only robbed of
his station supplies, but he was frequently
losing even cattle; while, instead of seeing
any prospect of amendment, he only perceived
that the successes of his despoilers were
emboldening them to fresh adventures. He
knew that an application to the government
for protection was absolutely useless; for
they hadn't it to give. It is true he might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
stir the district to agitate the settlement of a
native police detachment in that quarter; but
he also knew, even if he succeeded in obtaining
such a location, that the force would be
necessarily so miserably small as to be perfectly
inadequate to the contingencies. (Possibly
three or four men stationed in the centre
of fifty square miles to protect the scattered
population against as many hundred savages.)
The idea was preposterous, and he scouted it.
No, he thought, he must depend upon himself
for protection, and would therefore adopt a
line of policy that would check, if not
annihilate, the nuisance; while the exigencies
of the case would justify him in his measures.
Such, then, were the thoughts that passed
through the mind of Mr. Rainsfield after his
interview with our hero.</p>

<p>He returned to Mr. Billing's cottage after
John Ferguson's departure, and accosted his
<i>employé</i> in his blandest and most suasive
manner. "Mr. Billing," said he, "I am about
to enter upon a crusade against the native<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
dogs, which I find are becoming very troublesome
to the sheep in the upper part of the
run; and, to effectually destroy them, I intend
to poison some carcasses to be left for
them to make a meal of. I would therefore
like you to ride over to Alma, and explain
the matter to Mr. Gilbert, the storekeeper
there; and procure for me a supply of
strychnine and arsenic. I would not trouble
you, but you are aware that he would not
give it to a shepherd without a request from
me; and it is hardly safe to send any of the
men. I would be particularly obliged to you
if you would undertake the task, as I can
confidently depend upon your judgment to
prevent any mistake."</p>

<p>This little piece of what the Yankees would
designate "soft sawder" on the part of Rainsfield,
had the effect, not only of removing any
objections his diminutive confidential might
have had to such a journey, but of inducing
him to acknowledge the compliment in a series
of corporeal oscillations; while he replied to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
the blandishment, in the following strain: "It
would afford me, sir, the greatest earthly
pleasure to comply with your wishes; even
to the considerable personal inconvenience,
sir, and bodily suffering of your humble servant;
but you must be aware equestrianism
sir, is an accomplishment I never deemed it
necessary to acquire. During my mercantile
career, sir, I was reputed, and I think I may
add justly too, sir, one of the best amateur
whips in the city of London; and had my
transit, sir, to be effected by a vehicular means,
I flatter myself, sir, none could accomplish the
mission better."</p>

<p>"That I am convinced of," replied Mr.
Rainsfield; "but I fear, Mr. Billing, I shall
have to defer the pleasure of witnessing your
skill in handling the ribbons until I am
induced, by the existence of roads, to treat
myself and my family to the luxury of a carriage.
But, with regard to the journey I have
mentioned, I can provide you with a quiet
horse; and I have no doubt a man of your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
various accomplishments will find no difficulty
in adding to them the art of riding. In fact,
unless you had mentioned it, I would never
have imagined but that you were a perfect
equestrian; your stature and figure are just
such as would show to best advantage on
horseback; and, with the constant opportunities
which present themselves here, I really
am surprised that you don't ride. You know
'it is never too late to mend;' so you must
really permit me to persuade you (irrespective
of this journey) to commence at once
practising the art, and take a regular course
of riding. I am convinced you will not only
find it pleasant, but beneficial to your health."</p>

<p>"I appreciate your kindness, sir," replied
the little man. "As you say, it is never too
late to mend, and I really think, sir, it is
ridiculous that I should not be able to ride;
but the fact is, to be candid, sir, I have always
dreaded the first lesson."</p>

<p>"There is really nothing to fear, Mr. Billing,"
said Rainsfield. "You will find, once on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
your horse, riding will come natural to you;
the only inconvenience you will experience is
being at first a little stiff after it."</p>

<p>"When would you desire me to start, if I
took this journey?" enquired the would be
equestrian.</p>

<p>"Well, I should prefer it at once," replied
his tempter. "If you were to start within
half an hour you would have at least six hours
of daylight; and the distance is only about
twenty-five miles, so you could reach the town
at your leisure before dark, and return to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I have decided then, sir," exclaimed Mr.
Billing; "you may command my services, and
I will be at your disposal before the expiration
of half an hour."</p>

<p>"That's right, Mr. Billing," replied his
superior; "and I'll get a horse in from the
paddock for you; and by the way, will you
just leave the keys of the store with Mrs. Billing.
When you are away I purpose removing
all the stores into the house, and have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
prepared a room for their reception; so if our
black visitors should favour us with a call
during your absence they will find themselves
disappointed."</p>

<p>"Most assuredly, sir, as you desire," replied
the quondam commercial; "I will hand the
badges of my office into your hands myself,
to prevent, sir, the possibility of any mistake:"
saying which the two separated; Mr. Billing
filed with the importance of his mission, to
communicate it to his wife, and obtain her aid
in a speedy preparation for his hazardous
journey; and his employer, with a complaisant
smile of satisfaction on his features, to give
instructions for the immediate capture of a
steed.</p>

<p>Within the specified time an animal was
brought by Mr. Rainsfield up to the door of
Mr. Billing's abode duly caparisoned for the
journey, and with an old valise strapped upon
the saddle. At the same time the adventurous
storekeeper also made his appearance; having
undergone by the careful assiduity of his wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
a perfect transmutation. On his head stood
erect a black cylindrical deformity, designated
in the vulgar parlance of the colony "a Billy,"
but which he, while he smiled benignly at the
ignorance of the <i>canaille</i> (as he gave it the
extra rotary flourish of the brush, while he
read "Christy's best London make" in the
crown), called a hat; and the only proper
head-dress for a gentleman. He was encompassed
in a coat of the gigantic order, possessed
of many pockets; a garment truly
noble to look upon, and one that had done
service to its owner in days of yore; when on
cold and wet mornings Mr. Billing nestled
himself in his wonted position in the Brixton
'bus, to be conveyed to his diurnal bustle in
the city. In this habiliment evidences of an
affectionate wife's forethought were visible in
the protrusion from the pockets of sundry
pieces of paper, denoting the occupation of
those receptacles by certain parcels; the
contents of which, should the reader be
anxious to know, we are in a position to disclose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>In the lower pocket on the right hand side,
we are enabled from our information (which is
from the most reliable source) to inform the
curious, was a parcel (thrust by Mrs. Billing
with her own hands) enclosing two garments,
of a spotless purity, essential for a gentleman's
nocturnal comfort. In the contemporary
pouch was a package of humbler pretensions,
containing sundries to appease a traveller's
appetite; while in another was deposited that
necessary paraphernalia for a morning's toilet,
embraced in the apparatus known as a "gentleman's
travelling companion." His legs were
encased in trousers that had been brought
specially to the light. They were of a questionable
colour, something between that of
kippered salmon and hard bake; and were
strapped down to his feet with such powerful
tension that he was threatened every moment
with a mishap most awkward in its consequences.
When he walked he effected the
exercise with a sprightliness that appeared as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
if galvanic agency was that which had set his
nether limbs in motion; and his feet started
from the ground at every step with a spring
that promised at each evolution the protrusion
of some part of his crural members.</p>

<p>In this perfect costume Mr. Billing considered
himself adjusted for the road; and
construing the smile of amusement that played
on the features of Mr. Rainsfield as a mark of
affability returned it in his most winning
style.</p>

<p>The horse provided for this Gilpin excursion
was an animal of no mean pretensions. He
boasted of having in his veins some of the
best blood of the country, though, now perhaps,
that blood was somewhat vapid, and he rather
patriarchal. He had served many masters,
and performed various duties; from racing to
filling the equivocal position of a station and
stockman's hack. Though once possessed of
a spirit that required a strong arm and determined
will to maintain a mastery over, he
was now as quiet and subdued as a lamb; although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
he was as sagacious as most of his
riders, and as knowing as any "old hoss" in
the country. He had settled into an easy-going
stager, that neither persuasion nor force
could induce to deviate from the "even tenor
of his way;" while his general appearance, at
this stage of his life, was long-legged, raw-boned,
lean and screwed, with the additional
embellishment of being minus his near eye.</p>

<p>Mr. Billing surveyed the beast that was to
carry him to Alma with about the same comprehension
as a ploughman would contemplate
a steam engine; while the horse returned the
gaze from the corner of his sound eye, and
winked in a manner that might have been
interpreted into a request "to wait until he
got him on his back." Mr. Billing, however,
was perfectly unacquainted with the significance
of his horse's looks, and perhaps well for
him that he was; for we are convinced, had
he known what was in store for him, he would
never have risked his valuable person and life
on the back of so perverse a dispositioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
animal. We have heard that an inclination
of the head is equivalent to the closing of one
eye to a quadruped whose ocular organs are in
a state of total derangement; and we therefore
presume that the momentary stultification of
our quadruped's vision had the same effect
upon our Cockney-born viator as the craniological
recognition mentioned in the aphorism
would have had on his horse. Consequently,
he was in blissful ignorance of the trials that
awaited him; and, under the directions of Mr.
Rainsfield, he prepared to mount with an
alacrity which he prided himself as pertaining
to a "city man of business," and which he
still retained in his animated anatomy.</p>

<p>For some time he experienced considerable
difficulty, in fact he found it absolutely impossible,
to so far stretch his limbs as to get
one leg high enough from the ground to
reach the stirrup; and not until, at the
suggestion of his highly-amused employer, his
loving spouse produced a chair from the
cottage, had he any prospect of reaching the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
saddle. However, being elevated by the chair,
he made a bound on to the back of the steed,
but unfortunately with too great an impetus;
for he lost his equilibrium in attempting to
gain his seat, and measured his length on the
ground. This mishap tended to cast a gloom
upon his spirits, but he was soon rallied by
Mr. Rainsfield, who told him he would be all
right when once in his saddle and on the
road. Upon a second attempt he exercised
more caution, with better success; and, as he
seated himself in his saddle bolt upright, he
gazed about him, and below him, with a proud
consciousness of the elegant symmetry of
himself and horse; and doubted not he would,
as he then stood, be a prize study for any
sculptor. His following remark will not
therefore be wondered at.</p>

<p>"As you a few minutes ago affirmed, sir,
now that I am possessed of my seat, I do feel
myself all right. I experience, sir, a confidence
in myself that, if called upon, I could do
any equestrian prodigy, even to eclipse the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
stupendous leap of Martius Curtius; or to
perform, sir, any other feat that my destiny
may decree."</p>

<p>"I am equally confident in your abilities,
Mr. Billing," replied his master; "but I trust
they will never be put to so severe a test. I
will walk with you to where the roads to Alma
and Brompton diverge. It is not more than a
mile beyond the Wombi, so, though I can tell
you yours is the left hand road, I may as well
accompany you to the junction. From that
you will have no difficulty in keeping to the
track, if you just give the horse his head; for
he has been so used to the road that he will
know perfectly well where he has to go. You
will perceive I have strapped a valise on your
saddle; it is for you, when you procure the
poisons, to put them into it, and keep them
out of harm's way; while it will save you the
annoyance and trouble of carrying them."</p>

<p>When they arrived at the spot where the
tracks separated Mr. Rainsfield parted from
his colleague; and looking after him for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
few minutes, until he was lost from view by
a turn in the road, he burst into an inordinate
fit of laughter, and turned on his heel to
retrace his steps. After walking for some
time in abstracted silence, apparently absorbed
in deep meditation, he suddenly started with
the ejaculation, "Yes! by Jupiter, that'll stop
them. I expect they won't trouble me much
after that."</p>

<p>But while we leave him to his cogitations
and silent walk, we will pursue Mr. Billing
and accompany him on his ride.</p>

<p>When he departed from his master, as we
have described in the last chapter, Mr. Billing
went on his way with a joyful heart. But,
thinking the slow walking pace of his steed
might safely be improved upon; and also considering,
that if he could only prevail upon
the horse to walk a little faster, it would
facilitate his journey amazingly; he commenced
a series of exhortations that were excellent
adjuncts to the theory which advocates
the superiority of persuasion to the application<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
of force, but extremely ineffective in
practice, when the subject is a quadruped of
rather a stubborn nature, and perfectly ignorant
of the vernacular in which he is addressed.
Thus, when Mr. Billing endeavoured to accelerate
the speed of his animal, by the utterance
of such pathetic and endearing appeals, as
"now, come along, poor old horsey;" "there's
a good old horse;" "ge up;" "now, don't be
angry" (as the beast showed signs of uneasiness);
"walk a little faster, like a good old
horse;" we say we would not have been surprised,
had the horse paid no more heed to
Mr. Billing's entreaties than we should be likely
to do, were we addressed in a lively asinine
interpellation, by one of those animals, whose
peculiar idiosyncrasies are proverbial. But,
strange to say in this case, the horse did notice
the requests of his rider. Whether he was an
animal of superior discernment, and detected
the wishes of Mr. Billing in the tone of that
gentleman's appeals; or, whether the intonation
sounded to his ears strange and novel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
and stimulated him with a desire to accommodate
the applicant; or, whether he himself
became anxious to reach his destination, to
realize his visions of a stable and a feed, we
cannot venture to say. But we simply record
the fact, that Mr. Billing's request to the "old
horse" was complied with; and the quadruped
went off in a step, which was an incongruous
mixture of a shambling walk, a canter, and
a trot.</p>

<p>That fable of the frogs, who in answer to
their prayer for a king, obtained a carnivorous
monarch of the aves genus, has no doubt
been forcibly impressed on the memories of
our readers during their scholastic probation.
They will readily, then, understand the feelings
of Mr. Billing, when he imprecated his rashness
for disturbing the equanimity of his
horse's pace; and we are convinced that the
animals in the apologue never prayed more
fervently for a discontinuance of their visitation
than he did for an alleviation of his
misery. All his "woa's," and "stop old horse's,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
were perfectly unavailing; the quadruped
proceeded without the slightest notice, and
with the greatest unconcern. But the torment
to the biped was dreadful. What was
he to do? He had uttered the talismanic syllable,
that had called up the spirit; while he
was not possessed of the power to exorcise it.
His agony of body, was only equalled by that
of his mind. He remembered Mr. Rainsfield
had said the animal never went out of one
step; and if that in which he then was should
be the step, which he would of a necessity
continue during the whole of the journey,
what would become of him? The thought was
horrible and insuperable; but he, Mr. Billing,
the quondam pride of Thames Street, could
not answer it; and in a stoical distress of
mind he gave vent to a sigh, which seemed to
jolt out by inches the centre of his little
fastidious anatomy. He a thousand times
wished himself back again, safe alongside the
partner of his bosom; when no power on
earth should persuade him to submit again to
so ignoble a position and spectacle, as a ride<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
on horseback. But something must be done,
he thought; for as the horse proceeded in his
jogging step, so did Mr. Billing continue to be
battered by his jolting.</p>

<p>The unfortunate equestrian was a perfect
picture of distress. At every step of the
animal, he was almost bounded from his seat.
He could not speak, for the breath was almost
shaken out of his body; while he dared not
look around for fear of losing his equilibrium.
He had also lost his hold of the bridle, which
he dropt on the horse's neck; while he seized
the pommel of the saddle for his further
security, with the air and grasp of a resolute
man who preferred even torture to the
indignity of being unseated.</p>

<p>What Mr. Billing's appearance was, when
he was undergoing this ordeal, our readers
who have witnessed a first riding lesson can
easily imagine; and would, no doubt, were
they witnesses of the scene, be ready to laugh
at the victim's sufferings as we penitently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
confess ourselves to have done. Our friend's
torture, however, continued as he turned over
in his mind the best means of obtaining relief.
If he should be so far fortunate as to meet
any one in the road who would kindly stop
the refractory animal, he thought, how grateful
he would be; but of that he feared there was
little chance. A thought, however, struck him
and suddenly illumined his perturbed spirit.
Why could he not stop him himself? It never
occurred to him before, but now he experienced
a gleam of hope; he thought, if he could but
pull the bridle, the animal would cease his
torturing career. But then how was he to
effect this? If he relinquished his hold, he
might lose his seat; however, he determined
to try, and, summoning all his energies to his
aid, he suddenly relaxed his grasp of the
saddle, seized the bridle, and gave it as violent
a tug as his strength would permit. His
object, however, was not gained; for in his
avidity to stop the horse he had pulled on the
one side of the bridle, and his Rosinante, instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
of slackening his speed to the desired
pace, turned his head and looked Cyclops-like
at his rider, in a way that said as plainly as
looks could: "What is it you want?" But
we have already stated that Mr. Billing was
not versed in the significance of horse's looks,
so he understood it not; but continued to
tug with a violence that threatened his own
downfall, and the dislocation of the quadruped's
jaw.</p>

<p>Servants, however industrious and painstaking,
may sometimes find it difficult with
petulant employers to ascertain the precise
wishes of their superiors; and not unfrequently
have we witnessed some truculent
master abusing his menials for an act, the
very nadir of which had previously met with
his disapprobation; leaving the abusees in a
state of doubt as to what really were the
desires of "the master." In the same way was
the horse in our narrative. He turned his
head in the direction indicated by Mr. Billing's
tug; and finding it still continued, he followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
with his whole body; and, possibly under the
impression that he was required to return
home in the same leisure trot, he commenced
a retrogression. That was not, however, what
his rider required, at least while his journey was
unaccomplished; for though, for his personal
comfort, he devoutly desired it, such a course
of action could not be thought of. Mr. Billing
was a man of honour, and volunteered to
perform the duty; had even pledged his
word; while his respected master had told
him that he relied upon his good judgment;
therefore, was such a confidence to be misplaced,
and his integrity to be called into
question? "Never!" Mr. Billing mentally
ejaculated; even if his life were to be sacrificed
in an expenditure of sighs. An imputation
of such a dereliction had never been
cast upon the name of Billing, and should he
be the first to disgrace the family? He
mentally replied with an emphatic and
forcible negative, and tugged away with increased
energy at the bridle he continued to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
hold in his hand.</p>

<p>It is needless to say the horse became bewildered
at the man&oelig;vering of his rider. He
had never experienced such treatment before,
and could not comprehend its meaning. He
stopped; the tugging continued. He turned
again, and the tugging ceased. He thus
discovered the desire of his director; and
being at the time somewhat accommodatingly
disposed, he proceeded at a snail-paced
ambulation. Our readers will have by this
time discovered that Mr. Billing's Rosinante
was an animal of rather a peculiar temperament;
and will therefore be prepared to hear
that, having gained some experience of the
style of individual on his back, he gave
evidences of a disposition which caused no
little uneasiness to the sensitive mind of the
Strawberry Hill Mercury. This highly to be
deprecated perversity, displayed itself in
various "little games" of his own, which
were performed with a degree of <i>nonchalance</i>
highly edifying to an admirer of coolness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
though extremely alarming to our friend.
Some of the most salient we may mention,
were, grazing in the bush at the side of the
track; rubbing himself against the trees;
taking erratic turns in search of water-holes;
and finally stopping altogether.</p>

<p>This trial was worse than all, and brought
Mr. Billing's patience to a culminating point.
That the poor animal should desire a drink
he thought in no way extravagant; but to
coolly stand still, and decline any further
progression, was the height of assumption;
which even he could not tolerate. He therefore
grew importunate in his demands for
locomotion; and vibrated his legs like pendulums,
while he shouted in a voice that betrayed
anger. He again seized the bridle,
and tugged away with equal violence as before,
only varying the operation by pulling alternately,
one side, and the other. Under this,
or some unaccountable influence, the horse
regained his amiability, and returned to the
road; and, moreover, took the right direction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
for Alma; which, though at a pace by no
means so fast as Mr. Billing could desire, yet
in one which he thought preferable to that,
the inconveniences of which he had had such
tangible proof. However, he now jogged on
at his leisure, and would doubtless have continued
to have done so without any further
adventure, had he not been disturbed from
his equanimity by the unmistakeable sounds
of an approaching bullock dray. The idea of
meeting this threw him into a perfect state
of perplexity, and he therefore thought of
getting off the track to allow it to pass; but
how to guide his perverse animal he knew
not. The sounds came nearer, but his horse
paid no attention to his admonitions; so, with
visions of being gored to death by bullocks,
he relinquished the contest with his animal,
and gave himself up for lost.</p>

<p>The dray slowly dragged its course along,
and approached within sight of our adventurous
friend; when its companions, amused at
the figure before them, halted their team to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
have a little conversation with one whose
appearance was truly enough to excite their
risibility. Mr. Billing's horse, in like manner,
aware that it was expected of him to halt, also
did so; and the individual, who officiated as
driver to the team, addressed the equestrian
in the following easy style of familiarity:</p>

<p>"I say, mate, don't you think you'd better
get inside?"</p>

<p>The force of this coarse joke was duly
appreciated by the utterer's travelling companions;
though it was entirely lost upon our
friend, who gazed in mute astonishment at his
questioner. While he indulges in this visual
inspection, we will crave permission to make
a slight digression, for the purpose of describing
the parties thus unceremoniously introduced
to the reader's notice.</p>

<p>The driver of the dray, and the individual
who had addressed Mr. Billing, was a man of
ordinary stature; slight in make, and past
the meridian of life. His features were sharp;
his hair was tinged with gray; his eyes were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
of the same colour, and somewhat sunken in
his head; on his chin and lip was hair of
about a week's growth, having very much the
appearance of a worn-out scrubbing brush, and
of quite as course a texture. He was clad in
the usual bushman's style, and carried the
long whip of his order. At his side walked a
young man, in appearance and manner a considerable
improvement on the old one; and
high upon the laden dray were perched two
females. One was an old dame with features
of the nut-cracker cast, and apparelled with an
evident desire to combine in her person all
the prismatic hues. Her more juvenile companion,
while emulating the same laudable
disposition, was certainly superior in looks to
her, in the same proportion as the young man
was to the old. The appearance of the whole
party was such as proclaimed them at once,
to the practised eye of Mr. Billing, to be of
a class having no pretensions to gentility;
though there was an air about them of careless
freedom and easy comfort that, to him, ill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
accorded with their position. He had satisfied
himself on this point, by his scrutiny, when
he ventured to reply to the before mentioned
remark of the old man by making the
following observation:</p>

<p>"May I be permitted, my good sir, to
enquire the nature of the expression you just
made use of? I presume you must have
spoken in metaphor."</p>

<p>"Not a bit, old cock," replied the man, "I
guess I spoke in English. You didn't seem to
enjoy travelling that ere way, so I just axed
you if you'd get inside."</p>

<p>"And pray, sir, what did you mean by
that?" asked Mr. Billing, whose choler began
to rise at what he considered the rude insolence
of his interrogator.</p>

<p>"Oh! nothing," replied the young man, who
saw that their new acquaintance was likely to
be a little irascible, "my father was only
joking."</p>

<p>"And pray, young man," said Mr. Billing,
"is not your father aware that it is a gross<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
breach of decorum his attempting to pass his
jokes off on a gentleman? eh, sir?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied the young fellow, "he
is quite aware of it, but he has got such a
way of joking with people that he does it all
the same with friends and strangers; and I
have no doubt he could not resist the temptation
of having a slap at you, when he saw
so elegant a rider and gentleman."</p>

<p>This attempt of the young witling, while it
highly amused the various members of the
travelling menage, pacified Mr. Billing; who
failed to perceive any irony in it; and, addressing
the elder of the party with his usual
suavity, he said, "May I be so bold as to
enquire sir, the point of your destination?
As I am not aware of the expectation of any
one at our place, I presume you are bound for
our neighbours at Fern Vale?"</p>

<p>"No, we ain't, old fellow," replied the party
addressed, "we are going to our own place,
t'other side of Fern Vale. I 'spose you don't
know us? My name's Sawyer, and this 'ere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
chap's my son: that there's my old woman
on the dray; and our gal alongside on her.
I've bought a run on the Gibson river, and
am going to settle on it now. So, as you know
all about us, take a 'ball,' and tell us who
you are." With which he handed to Mr.
Billing a bottle, containing some alcoholic
fluid; and took out his pipe which he inserted
between his teeth, and made to give
forth a whistling sound, to satisfy himself
upon the non-obstruction of the passage, preparatory
to replenishing it with the weed.</p>

<p>Mr. Billing having smelt the contents of
the bottle, which had rather a rummy odour,
returned it to old Sawyer with the remark:
"You really must excuse me, sir, for I invariably
make it a rule to abstain from spirits in
the middle of the day, and never at any time
drink them raw."</p>

<p>"We can give you water old 'bacca'
breeches, if you like it best that way," replied
Sawyer, sen.</p>

<p>"Not any, I thank you," said Billing, "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
would prefer, I assure you, sir, to be excused;
at the same time I value your kind attention."</p>

<p>"Well, here's luck to you, old feller," said
the other, as he took a pull at the bottle.
"I don't believe in watering grog, it spoils
good liquor. But I say, old cock, who are
you?"</p>

<p>"I, sir," said Mr. Billing, not exactly relishing
this unceremonious style of questioning,
and with difficulty suppressing his indignant
ire, at being so vulgarly addressed by a low-minded
besotted man. "I, sir," he repeated,
"am Mr. James Billing of Strawberry Hill,
and late of the firm of Billing, Barlow, &amp; Co.,
of the city of London." He said this with
the air of a man who would strike his interrogator
with a sense of that forwardness that
could prompt so rude a query as that which
had been made by the head of the Sawyer
family; and as one resolved to maintain the
honour of his position, and claim that respect
which was due to him as the representative
of that class which is the acknowledged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
source of England's greatness; viz., the mercantile
community.</p>

<p>"I 'spect Strawberry Hill ain't yourn?"
said Sawyer, unmindful of the reproof conveyed
in the tone and language of Mr. Billing.
"I believe it belongs to a chap of the name
of Rainsfield, don't it?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Rainsfield is the proprietor of the
station, sir," replied Billing, "and I am his
confidential assistant."</p>

<p>"Oh, the 'Super?' I suppose," exclaimed
the other.</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied our friend, "his accountant."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see," cried the old man, as the nature
of his interlocutor's position flashed across
his mind, "the storekeeper, that's all, eh?
and where are you going now, mate?"</p>

<p>"I can't see, sir," replied Mr. Billing, "how
that can interest you in the slightest degree.
I am not called upon to submit to your catechising;
you must be perfectly aware that
your questions are bordering on the impertinent;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
and but that I am a man of peace, I
would resent your inquisitiveness, sir, as an
insult."</p>

<p>"My father meant no offence, sir," said the
young man, while his parent gave vent to his
amusement in a prolonged whistle, "it is only
his way."</p>

<p>"And a most unwarrantable way too, sir,"
said the now irate commercial man.</p>

<p>"You need not get your rag out, old fellow,"
said the senior Sawyer, "if you can't
take a bit of chaff you oughtn't to live in the
bush."</p>

<p>"Of that, sir, I'm the best judge," replied
the indignant Billing. "No man is justified
in offering chaff, as you call it, to a gentleman;
more especially when the parties are
perfect strangers. I made no rude and inquisitive
remarks to you; and am surprised
that you should have ventured to utter them
to me."</p>

<p>"Well, old fellow," said the other, "I ain't
agoing to quarrel with you no how, so if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
don't mean to tell us where you're going, why,
you can just please yourself."</p>

<p>"That, sir, I intend to do," replied Mr. Billing;
"so, if you have no further enquiries to
make, we may just as well part company."</p>

<p>"All right, old chap," said Mr. Sawyer,
"we'll go;" and while he put his team in
motion, with his whip, he imparted a slight
titillation to the flanks of Mr. Billing's horse,
which caused that eccentric animal to go
off in the step most torturing to his rider,
amidst the united cachinnations of the Sawyer
family.</p>

<p>Mr. Billing experienced a return of all his
former horrors; but his efforts this time to
reduce his horse to a tractable obedience were
fruitless; the animal persisted in keeping to
his own pace, notwithstanding the various
tugs, bridle sawings, admonitions, and solicitations
of our disconsolate equestrian. He was
fain at last to give up the contention, and
submit to his fate; and, be it mentioned to
his commendation, he bore his torture to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
end of his journey with a degree of fortitude
perfectly astounding.</p>

<p>It was night when the horse stopped in
front of the "Woolpack" inn, at Alma, and
well was it for Mr. Billing's sensitiveness that
it was so; for it saved him from the cruel
jeers and laughter of the unsympathising
ignoramuses who would have been sure to
have made his misfortunes a subject for merriment.
He was aroused from the abstraction
of his calm resignation by the cessation of
motion; and he perceived, with a lively joy,
that his troubles were for the time at an
end. How he got down from his saddle we
are as ignorant as he was himself; though we
can affirm that he scrambled off in such a
manner as to bring himself to the ground in
a prostrate position. Upon recovering from
his surprise, after carefully brushing the dust
from his apparel, he noticed that his horse,
who was apparently well acquainted with the
<i>locale</i> of the place, had entered the yard, and
was standing at the stable door, waiting with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
an exemplary patience to be admitted. Leaving
him there, to be attended to by the proper
authority, our friend entered the house with
a step somewhat resembling the progression
which, is to be assumed, would be that of an
animated pair of compasses. He was met in
the passage of the hostel by an individual of
the masculine gender, who, with a sardonic
grin, asked him "if that 'ere 'oss what was
in the yard belonged to him;" and being
answered in the affirmative, and that the
repliant desired to be shown to the coffee-room,
and required supper and a bed, he remarked,
"I suppose you come from Mr. Rainsfield's?
I know'd his old 'oss the moment I seed
him, and he knows us as well as he does his
master."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" replied Mr. Billing, "it's very
probable, my good fellow; but I have no desire
to enter into a discussion with you respecting
the merits or acquaintances of the animal. I
would be exceedingly obliged to you if you
would show me to my bed-room, and let me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
have some supper as soon as possible."</p>

<p>"I don't think you've been much used to a
riding of 'orses, sir," said the cool stable functionary,
as he eyed our travel-worn friend
from apex to base. But Mr. Billing was too
indignant to answer him. He really thought
that all the vagabonds in the country had
conspired to insult him, and he determined to
submit to their contumelies no longer; so,
turning round upon his questioner, with a look
of indignant scorn, he said:</p>

<p>"I'll suffer no impertinence from you, sir,
and I have to request you'll refrain from
indulging in any further offensive remarks
and queries, sir. If you are the landlord of
this hostlery, sir, you are evidently unacquainted
with your business; and if you are
a servant in the establishment be good enough
to inform your master that I desire to speak
to him."</p>

<p>"All right, sir," replied the man, "if you
want to see the gov'ner I'll tell him." Saying
which, the facetious servant took his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
departure with an evident risible excitement.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the landlord himself made
his appearance; and received Mr. Billing's
order, and complaint against the domestic,
with as much indifference as if they were
matters not worth noticing; and without
deigning any acknowledgment or reply beyond
that which he put to his visitor in the
following words.</p>

<p>"Do you want anything to drink?"</p>

<p>"Not at present, I thank you," replied the
urbane son of commerce; "I desire first to have
something to eat."</p>

<p>"Oh! then you'll have to wait," replied the
landlord, "for we don't cook meals at this
time of night."</p>

<p>"Well, my good friend," replied Mr. Billing,
"I don't wish to inconvenience you, and your
household; but I am perfectly voracious, and
desire something solid. I am not fastidious
and would be content with something cold, if
your larder contains such."</p>

<p>"No, we ain't got nothing cold," replied the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
master of the "Woolpack;" "we never keep it:"
and with a grunt this specimen of politeness
left the room.</p>

<p>The unfortunate Mr. Billing was now subject
to another species of annoyance; and we
verily believe, had he not been the personification
of patience, he would have been perfectly
driven to distraction. Though shouts of
revelry, and indications of drinking, emanated
from the bar, he was not surprised or disturbed,
for he expected it; but he heard
sounds in the passage as of suppressed
laughter, accompanied by stifled expressions
in a strong Hibernian dialect. Whether the
utterance was by male or female, it was
difficult to conjecture; but Mr. Billing's
doubts (if he had had any on the subject)
were soon put to rest, for he plainly discerned
the frontispiece of a biped; which, by the
manner of arranging its natural scarlet covering,
plainly proclaimed itself as belonging
to the order of feminine. The features displayed
a broad grin; and an inquisitive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
glance met that of our friend, as he stood
facing the door. The head was hastily
withdrawn when its owner perceived it had
been noticed; but a laugh succeeded its withdrawal,
and another cranium was protruded
into the aperture, and retired in its turn with
a laugh, to make way for another.</p>

<p>Mr. Billing submitted to this scrutiny with
the assumed fortitude of a stoic; and attempted
to allay his rising ire, and deceive
his perturbed spirit, by whistling one of the
favourite airs from Norma. Now, Mr. Billing
prided himself upon the accomplishment
of whistling; for he did consider it an accomplishment,
notwithstanding that some people
call it vulgar. He had given it his study;
and when in the height of conviviality, when
he was at any time induced to favour his
friends with a specimen of his art, he would
throw his whole soul into the performance,
and remain an unconscious spectator of
passing events until the last note of his
Æolian melody died away amid the vociferous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
plaudits of his friends. He therefore, on this
occasion, resolved to indulge in a little music
to save himself from a knowledge of the
annoyance of the menials' gaze, and to show
them his utter contempt both for them and
their unparalleled rudeness. With his eyes,
then, firmly fixed upon a cleanly-dispositioned
fly on the canvas ceiling of the room, as it
was going through various crural manipulations
on its cranium, he warbled forth a
stanza in his most enchanting strain; so
exquisitely sweet as to have softened the
hearts of heathens had they been present.
At least so says Congreve, in his oft-used
sentiment, such is the opiate influence of
phrygian chords on unsophisticated natures;
but in the auditory of Mr. Billing it was
otherwise. They possessed no taste for
music, and only greeted his performance with
screams of laughter.</p>

<p>Human nature could not quietly submit to
this fresh indignity, and Mr. Billing advanced
with undisguised chagrin, and banged the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
door upon the sounds of retreating merriment.
He was annoyed, disgusted, and ill at ease;
and mentally made a resolution to get out of
the place as speedily as possible, and never
to darken the door again. It was fully an
hour before his expected repast was put upon
the table; and with a disturbed spirit, and
body racked with pains of unutterable puissance,
he partook of his meal and early sought
the consolation of his pillow.</p>

<p>On the following morning he habited and
arranged himself with punctilious neatness;
and waited upon Mr. Gilbert, the principal or
rather the only storekeeper in the town, for
the purpose of obtaining the articles required
by Mr. Rainsfield. Upon his procuring these
he arranged them in the valise prepared for
them, and settled his reckoning at the inn
previous to taking his departure. At his
desire the horse was brought to the door;
and, being provided with a chair, he effected
a mounting with less difficulty than on the
previous day. But his trials were not yet at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
an end; for not only the whole inmates of
the Woolpack inn, but almost the entire
population of the township (some hundred
people), assembled <i>en masse</i> to witness the
start of the potent personage. The horse was
set in motion by an admonitory application of
a stick by one of the bystanders, which started
him off in the step which was the dread of
our friend; while he was hailed on all sides
with a deafening cheer and shouts of laughter,
which rung in his ears for some distance
on his journey.</p>

<p>We last left John Ferguson returning to
Fern Vale after his interview with Mr. Rainsfield;
and he had reached his home, and had
actually dismounted from his horse, before
the merry laugh of his sister roused him from
his reverie. When Kate and the rest of the
party had reached the house, they were surprised
to find John absent; the more so as
they were informed he had ridden over in
the morning to Strawberry Hill. They certainly
had not passed him on the road, and
they thought there was no probability of his
having been diverted from his purpose; they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
therefore could not understand where he had
got to, though they agreed the best thing they
could do was to await his return.</p>

<p>William had taken them all over the place,
and through the house that was only waiting
the arrival of the furniture, to claim its pretty
little visitor as its mistress; and the party
were just emerging from the building, when
Kate spied her brother John approaching,
apparently absorbed in deep thought, and
perfectly deaf to the sound of the voices of
herself and her friends. When she, however,
saw him alight from his horse, at the huts a
short distance off, and perceived that he was
perfectly abstracted, she could restrain her
spirits no longer, and ran laughingly to throw
herself in his arms. It was at this moment,
that John Ferguson was made alive to the
fact that his home had been honoured by the
visit of his friends; and he advanced to meet
his sister, and greeted her with a fond inosculation,
as a token of fraternal affection.</p>

<p>We do not approve of the constant eduction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
of scenes of affectionate union, where
the thoughts, contemplations, and utterances,
the spontaneous ebullitions of love, are dragged
before the gaze of all. We deem them at all
times too sacred to be made subject to the
comments and criticism of uninterested parties;
and therefore, in the case of Kate's
meeting with her brother, would beg to draw a
veil over the scene, and wait, in the resumption
of our apologue, until they join their friends.</p>

<p>The various greetings and congratulations
were soon ended; and Tom Rainsfield commenced
the general conversation by asking of
his friend:</p>

<p>"What on earth became of you, John?
When we arrived here we were told you had
gone over to our place; but you had not
been there before we left, and if you had
gone by the track we should have met. I
suppose you were emulated with a desire for
discovery, and attempted to find a short cut
through the bush, eh?"</p>

<p>"No indeed," replied John, "I kept to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
road; but, I imagine, I must have been at
Strawberry Hill just before you started, for,
as I was coming up to the house, I saw
saddled horses at the door. I was called in
by Mr. Billing as I was passing his cottage,
as he said he desired a little conversation with
me; so I presume that, owing to that circumstance,
I missed you."</p>

<p>"What could have induced that inordinate
old humbug," continued Tom, "to have
drawn you into his den? I suppose to tell
you all about his family affairs."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied John, "he certainly did treat
me to a long dissertation on his misfortunes
in life; the greatest of which was his coming
to the colony, and which appears, <i>prima facie</i>,
to be the head and front of his offending."</p>

<p>"But didn't you ask for us?" enquired
Tom; "or did you see my brother? and did
he not tell you that we had gone over to your
place?"</p>

<p>"I did see Mr. Rainsfield," said John, "but
to tell you the truth, I did not go up to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
house."</p>

<p>"And you didn't even ask for me?" enquired
Mrs. Rainsfield. "I could hardly have believed
in such thoughtlessness in any of my
friends, and especially in you. Pray, sir, will
you make some explanation? I am almost
inclined to be angry with you. But, as we
intend to retain possession of your sister for
some time, we shall demand of you, as penance;
a constant attendance upon us at 'The Hill.'"</p>

<p>"I fear, my dear Mrs. Rainsfield," replied
John, "I must decline to enlighten you on my
remissness; and I am afraid also I shall prove
a refractory penitent; for, in the first place,
I think it highly improbable that I shall have
the pleasure of visiting Strawberry Hill again;
at least for a time. And I must take an early
opportunity of relieving you of the protection
of Kate."</p>

<p>"What does the man mean?" exclaimed
his good-natured lady visitor, in mock astonishment.
"Am I to understand that you not
only refuse to come and see us, but that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
are churlish enough to desire to seclude your
sister with yourself in mutual confinement?
You are really becoming perfectly mysterious,
John Ferguson. I do not understand all this,
and must insist upon a solution. Tell me,
now," continued she, as she went smilingly
up to him, "what is it that makes you estrange
yourself from us, and studiously avoid our
society? I think I can read you better than
to ascribe it to that little fracas at our pic-nic."</p>

<p>"I do not wish to pain you, my dear
madam," replied Ferguson, "by making an
explanation that I am confident will be extremely
disagreeable to you; rather let me
remain as I am, and retain your esteemed
friendship, and believe me I have good cause
for absenting myself from your house."</p>

<p>"Nay, I will not be satisfied with that,"
replied Mrs. Rainsfield, "you are only intensifying
my curiosity by endeavouring to evade
my demand; something has occurred, I am
sure, to make you so determined in your
avoidance of us; and I must know what it is.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
If you decline enlightening me on the subject
I must seek information from Mr. Rainsfield,
or Eleanor; so you had better make a virtue
of necessity, and tell me at once."</p>

<p>"I had much rather the subject had not
been broached," said John; "but, as you are
determined to know the cause of my elimination,
I suppose I must communicate what I
would sooner have buried in oblivion. It
appears that your husband has formed some
prejudice against me, the cause of which I am
unable to account for. I accidentally learnt
from my black boys that some espionage, in
connexion with your station, was meditated
by the Nungar tribe; and I took an early
opportunity of going over to Strawberry Hill
to apprise Mr. Rainsfield of the fact. He
received me with marked coolness, for what
reason I am at a loss to conjecture; and
actually accused me of exercising an incentive
influence over the tribe to his detriment.
I would willingly believe that he has formed
some misconception of my actions; but to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
impute such a motive to me is simply ridiculous.
He loaded me with invective, and
wound up his inflammatory tirade by requesting
that I would discontinue my visits to his
house; and before I recovered from my surprise
I found myself alone; though, even if
he had remained, I question if I should have
succeeded in disabusing his mind, for he
seemed in no disposition to listen to reason.
I have no doubt but that he will very soon
discover his error; but until then, you will
perceive, Mrs. Rainsfield, it is utterly impossible
that I can pay my respects to you at
'The Hill;' and it would also, under the circumstances,
be highly inconsistent in Kate
stopping longer with you than can be
helped."</p>

<p>"I am truly grieved," replied the lady, "to
hear of your rupture with my husband, Mr.
Ferguson; it gives me great pain, I can assure
you. I can't think he can be prejudiced
against you, for he always entertained the
highest esteem for you. It is possible he may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
have formed some erroneous impression with
regard to those horrid blacks; but, whatever
is the cause of the ill feeling, I will endeavour
to dispel it; and have your friendship reestablished
upon the old footing. But, in the
meantime, it is impossible that you can take
Kate away from us; you can't put her into
an empty house, and you certainly would not
have the cruelty to lodge her in those huts of
yours. You must leave her with us, at least
until you have made a comfortable home for
her; and even then, I don't think the poor
girl will have a very enviable life, living in
seclusion, without a female near her."</p>

<p>"I have already thought of that," replied
John, "and have hired a man and his wife;
the latter, who is a professed cook, will be
entirely under Kate's direction. Besides, our
little black fellow, Joey, whom we brought
from New England with us, is as useful, if not
more so, as half the female servants in the
country. So I think, on that score, we will
be able to make our sister perfectly comfortable."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>"At all events," said Mrs. Rainsfield, "it is
understood you leave her with us until your
furniture arrives."</p>

<p>"Very well," replied John, "I suppose it
must be so. I need not beg of you to refrain
from mentioning to any one in your house,
not even to Kate, that any unpleasantness
exists between our families; your own good
judgment will convince you of the non-necessity.
But suppose we join our friends,
for we appear to have wandered quite away
from them during our conversation;" and
John Ferguson, and Mrs. Rainsfield, returned
to the spot where the rest of the party stood.</p>

<p>"Well, it is to be hoped you two are satisfied
with your 'confidential,'" remarked Tom,
as the parties thus addressed joined the
<i>menage</i>. "We were beginning to think you
were meditating an elopement, and were just
proposing giving you chase. We are agitating
the question of return. Miss Ferguson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
says she does not like this dreadful wilderness
of yours, John, and is anxious to get back to
Strawberry Hill, and within the bounds of
civilisation."</p>

<p>"Oh, what a dreadful falsehood!" cried
Kate, "you know I never said such a thing;
for that I am half disposed to stop here at
once, and if I thought it would be any punishment
to you, I would. I am sure my brother
would make room for me if I desired it."</p>

<p>"I offer an abject apology, my dear Miss
Ferguson," exclaimed the culprit; "we could
not dream of losing you now; so I will make
any reparation necessary to appease you."</p>

<p>"Well, then behave yourself, sir, and adhere
to the truth," said Kate.</p>

<p>"I think, my dear," said Mrs. Rainsfield,
"we really had better return, or it will be
dark before we get home; so if Tom did not
read your thoughts, his fib suggested an expediency."
Kate now took leave of her
brother; and Mrs. Rainsfield, she, and Tom
mounted their horses, and departed; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
latter turning in his saddle as he left the
station, called out to John, "I'll be over in
the morning;" and the party were speedily
lost to sight.</p>

<p>Mr. Wigton and the brothers turned into
the hut, and were soon engaged in a
conversation, which, though interesting to
themselves, it is unnecessary for us to follow.
Towards the close of the evening as they sat
before their hut, the brothers enjoying their
pipes over the fire that was boiling the water
for the infusion of the temperate beverage
that graced their board at the evening meal;
and while Joey, who officiated in the culinary
department, was preparing the repast in the
interior of the domicile, the dray that we
have met already on the road from Alma,
was seen to wind slowly off the face of the
ridge and down the vale to the creek that
ran through it. Here it stopped, while the
driver seemed to hold an altercation with his
companions, and appeared to be undecided
as to some course they were meditating.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who are those people, William?" said
his brother. "Where on earth can they be
going? Just step down and see; for they
must surely have gone out of their way, and
find themselves now at a stand still."</p>

<p>William walked down to the spot where
the dray had halted; and returned in a few
minutes with the information, that the travellers
were on their way to take possession of a
"run" one of the party had bought, on the
river below their own place, from Bob Smithers;
and stated that he had told the fellow
that he might camp where he was, and go
over and form his station on the following
day; he had also invited him to come up to
the hut in the evening and smoke his pipe,
which the man had promised to do. His
name, William said, was Sawyer; and he
appeared to be an individual who had not
been blessed with either much cultivation or
education. "He is," said William, "a regular
specimen of an old hand, and I expect has
seen much service."</p>

<p>In the course of the evening Mr. Sawyer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
made his appearance with his "old woman,"
as he familiarly designated his wife, and
daughter. The family was unaltered in
appearance since we last introduced it to the
reader; and while the females took their
seats on two stools, provided for them by the
Fergusons, in a stiff and formal manner
which they intended for a distinguishing
mark of good breeding, the old man threw
himself down on the grass before the fire.
After collecting a few sticks, and throwing
them on himself, he lit his pipe with a "fire
stick," and commenced the following conversation;
which he continued between the
intervals of his smokey eructations.</p>

<p>"I suppose you ain't been here long, mate,"
said he, addressing John; "you look as if you
had newly settled, and the country here can't
have been long taken up."</p>

<p>"It is true," replied John, "we have not
been resident here very long, not yet twelve
months. My brother tells me you have purchased
the block of country below us; may I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
ask if you are about to stock it?"</p>

<p>"Well, I ain't agoing to do nothing else.
You see I have got my dray down there with
my rations, and traps; and I am now going
over to fix upon a place for my station, and
put up some huts and yards. We have
bought our stock on the 'Downs,' and my
other son is there now, waiting for me to go
back, to be there while the sheep are drafted.
We must get a place up first to put the old
woman and the girl in, and then we will look
after the stock."</p>

<p>"But," said William, "you surely are not
going to leave your wife and daughter alone,
while you go back to the Downs for your
flocks? It can't be your intention to leave
them unprotected, in this part of the bush?
Are you aware of the freedom of the blacks
here?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Sawyer, "I don't know much
about the blacks in these parts; 'cos I ain't
seen much of them yet; but I know just
exactly what they were on the Hunter twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
years ago; and I be sure they arn't worse
here than they were there; and my old
woman has had as much to do with them as
me. Do you think I am afraid to leave her
by herself? Lord bless you, sir; my word!
she is 'all there' to take care of herself; and
in her own house I'll back her against any
dozen white men and any fifty blacks."</p>

<p>"You are quite at liberty," said John, "if
you like, after you have built your huts, to
leave your wife and daughter and your stores
and things here to await your own return."</p>

<p>"I am obliged to you, young man," exclaimed
old Sawyer; "but I'd rather leave
them at our own station, and I reckon they
would rather stop there themselves; besides
if I built my huts, and then left them, the
blackguardly blacks would most likely burn
them."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Sawyer, you can please yourself,"
replied John, "but you are quite welcome to
make use of our place if you like."</p>

<p>"All right, sir," replied he addressed, "I've<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
no doubt; but you see I've no fear of my old
woman being alone, so I shall just leave her
to bide until I come back. Howsomdever we
shan't be long away, and I don't think I shall
be so lucky as to find, when I do come back,
that anybody has run away with her."</p>

<p>"I trust, Mr. Sawyer," continued John, "you
may have no cause to reprehend yourself for
your confidence in your wife's ability to protect
herself and her daughter; and, if we can be
of any service to them, I trust you will make
no scruple in commanding us; for we desire to
live on terms of amity with our neighbours, and
it is essential to be mutually obliging at times."</p>

<p>"In course, young fellow; you are a brick,
so give me your hand," cried the head of the
Sawyer family, as he started to his feet, "we
must have a nobbler on the strength of that;"
saying which he abstracted a bottle from the
breastine recesses of his garments, and handed
it to John, who called to Joey to bring some
pannikins and water.</p>

<p>"I must apologize," said he, "for not offering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
you a glass of grog myself before this;
but, to tell you the truth, we have not got
any on the station, and here we don't usually
drink it; but to keep you company, I don't
mind taking a small drop."</p>

<p>The bottle was handed to Mr. Wigton,
William, and the women in succession; the
two former of whom declined, and the latter
partook; while the dispenser himself filled
out a jorum for his personal libation, and
drank success to himself, and the world
generally, in that comprehensive aphorism
which seemed to him to answer for all
occasions; viz., "here's luck." He felt disappointed,
however, when, upon a second
presentation of the "homiletical stimulator,"
he found no one to join him, and he remarked
with an apparent degree of truth:</p>

<p>"Why, I never did see fellers like you refuse
good liquor. I can't think how you can
do it; for my part, I'm blow'd if I ever do:
it's a sin."</p>

<p>"Don't you think, my good man," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
Mr. Wigton, "it's rather a sin to indulge too
freely in its use? If you do not think so,
I can assure you that it is; to say nothing
of the moral degradation of the drunkard,
the lavish squandering of your means, and
the injury to your health."</p>

<p>"Lor' bless you, sir," replied Sawyer, "I
never felt the worse of my liquor. I might
ha' been a bit drunk now and then, but what's
the odds of that? I get all right again in a
giffey; I wouldn't give a snuff for a fellow
that couldn't take his grog, and get drunk
now and then like other men. When I was
an overseer on the Hunter some years ago, a
mate of mine and me got two gallons of rum
up to my hut, to have a spree one night.
One of my fellows, who was an assigned 'un,
was a decent cove, though he never spoke to
the other men, 'cos he thought hisself a real
gent. Well I pitied this coon; and seeing
him that evening, I asked him if he'd come
up to my hut, and have 'a ball' or two with
us; but bless you, he flew into a pelter, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
called us all sorts of names, because, he said,
we wanted to make beasts of ourselves; just
as if having a bit of a spree, was making of
beasts of ourselves, and as if we hadn't a right
to drink our own grog. Well, thinks I, you
are a chicken; but I lets him 'ave his own way;
and what do you think, sir? He took to bush-ranging
and was hanged. Now, do you think
he was better than me, for not getting drunk
that time?"</p>

<p>"In his refusal, he certainly showed an
appreciation of right, whatever his previous
or after career may have been," replied Mr.
Wigton. "But, Mr. Sawyer, you must really
permit me to impress upon you the absolute
uselessness of drinking to excess; its sinfulness
I will be able to convince you of
afterwards. In the outset of your spree, as
you call it, you provide a stock of spirits,
which you lay yourself out to drink, uninterruptedly,
until it is finished. After the
first hour you become quite unconscious of
everything around you, while you continue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
to drink mechanically, without actually
knowing you are doing so, and certainly
without your palate experiencing any gratification.
So that the greater portion of the
spirits you have drank has been consumed
without affording you any satisfaction; in
fact, wasted; and your money thrown away.
Now, consider, what are the effects of this
spree? If you are of a good constitution,
and escape <i>delirium tremens</i>, are not your
sufferings still very acute? far more so than
to be commensurate to the wild excitement
of the debauch? You are sick, your head
seems every moment ready to split; you are
for days absolutely wretched and ill; and
not until your constitution works off the ill
effects of your dissipation do you recover
your wonted health; whereas, if you had
confined yourself to drinking your grog in
moderation, you would have enjoyed it for
a lengthened period, escaped all the unpleasant
symptoms I have mentioned, and
not injured your health; so you will perceive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
that drunkenness is useless. I am well
aware that it is difficult to convince men such
as you, who like their grog, to such a belief;
but if you could only be induced to try abstinence
I have no doubt you would readily agree
with me, with regard to its sinfulness."</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind that," cried Sawyer, "I
don't want to have no sermon; if I like to
buy grog, and drink it all at once, it don't
hurt nobody but me; and if I choose to do it,
why, it is my look out, and don't matter to
anybody else. But come along, old woman,"
he continued, addressing his wife, "we must
be going down to our camp;" and turning
round to John, he said, "we left our boy
down with the dray, and he will be thinking
the time long without us."</p>

<p>"I'll come over to you in the morning," said
William," I may be of some assistance to you,
as I have no doubt you will want to get up a
covering for the females as soon as possible."</p>

<p>"All right, young man, we will be glad to
see you," replied Sawyer; saying which, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
uttering a general "good night," that was
echoed by his accompanying helpmate and
progeny, he bent his steps towards the light
of his own fire; and was speedily lost in the
gloom.</p>

<p>"I could have desired," said Mr. Wigton, as
the Sawyers departed, "more eligible neighbours
for you than those people, and should
recommend you, at the outset, not to permit
too much familiarity from them; nor to cultivate
a very close degree of acquaintanceship.
It is as well to preserve a good feeling as
neighbours; but for Kate's and your own
sakes I would recommend that you let them
understand at once, by your manner, that you
do not intend to admit them on an equality.
The example they would set to you all, especially
to your sister, I consider highly reprehensible;
and it is better to avoid at once the
possibility of contamination than discard it
when once the infection is made palpable."</p>

<p>"I think with you," said John, "that they
are by no means desirable neighbours; and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
will certainly follow your advice. I did not
like the appearance of the people from the
first; and the offer I made them to remain
here I could not in common civility avoid;
however, I am happy they did not accept it,
and only regret that William should have
promised to go over to them."</p>

<p>"Oh," said William, "I only want to learn
something of that man's history. I know his
life must have been an eventful one from the
few remarks he made while here. You may
believe me, otherwise I have no desire to
devote much of my time to his or his family's
society."</p>

<p>"You are quite right William," said Mr.
Wigton; "but tell me," said he, turning to
John, "what arrangements have you made
for the reception of your sister? I see you
have got a very nice little cottage, but it will
surely take you some time to put things in
perfect order for her."</p>

<p>"I expect," said John, "a dray up every
day with furniture, and the necessity utensils<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
for the commencement of our housekeeping.
If anything is amiss we must fall back on
William, for he selected them. When they
arrive they shall be put in as good order as
possible; I have engaged a man and his wife,
and with the assistance of the latter, I think
Kate will get on swimmingly. She will have
very kind neighbours at Strawberry Hill, who
are extremely anxious to keep her with them;
and I am sure will be very attentive to her
when she settles herself with us. So I think,
so far, everything appears auspicious; though
I would considerably have preferred having
the house ready for her at once. To-day I
came to an open rupture with Rainsfield, and
he forbade me his house for the future; under
which circumstance I think it is hardly right
for one member of our family to be partaking
of his hospitality."</p>

<p>"I am grieved to hear of your quarrel,"
remarked Mr. Wigton; "how did it occur? is
it possible to heal the breach?"</p>

<p>"Why, for my own part," said John, "it were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
easy; but, judging from the animus displayed
by my opponent, I do not think it would be
readily accomplished. Mr. Rainsfield is under
the strange hallucination that I am influencing
the blacks in their depredations on him;
and when I called upon him, to put him upon
his guard against impending danger, he
attacked me with surprising virulence. I fear
the quarrel is irremediable, and I only now
desire to get Kate away; I have got every
thing here comfortably arranged for her, and
am only waiting for the furniture to complete
her home."</p>

<p>"I think you are perfectly right," replied
the clergyman, "in your desire to bring your
sister under your own roof; though, I have
no doubt, she would desire to remain a short
time longer with the kind ladies whose friendship
she has been fortunate enough to secure.
But it is only proper that she should join you
when you complete your arrangements, in
which, I think you have certainly shown some
judicious management. I am sure Kate will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
reward you by settling into a first-rate little
house-wife. She is a good, kind-hearted, affectionate
girl; and, from what I have witnessed,
I only think you will be speedily called upon
to part with her; for, you may depend, such
a treasure as she is will soon be discovered,
even in this remote spot."</p>

<p>"I expect that will be the result of our
training," said John, laughingly; "but, if our
sister's happiness will be furthered by the
severance, I will be truly happy to make the
sacrifice; though I don't think we have much
fear of losing her for some time to come. But
tell us, my dear friend, about your own movements.
I trust you intend favouring us with
your company for some lengthened period."</p>

<p>"I can remain with you for some little
time," replied Mr. Wigton, "perhaps a fortnight
or more; but next month I am expected
to be in Brisbane, and will, therefore, have to
leave you in time to reach town before the
middle of next month. I am particularly desirous
of having some interviews with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
blacks of your neighbouring tribe, to endeavour,
if possible, to ameliorate their wretched
condition; and, if you have no objection, I
will get you to pilot me to their camp."</p>

<p>"With all my heart," said John, "I am
quite at your service whenever you desire to
go, and I am sure William will join us too;
what do you say, Will?"</p>

<p>"By all means," replied he, "I'll go over
with you, if you like, to-morrow afternoon,
when I return from those people below us.
You will have a good opportunity of speaking
to them, Mr. Wigton, as the greater part of
the tribe is assembled in the scrub just now."</p>

<p>After making the best arrangements they
could for their visitor in their limited accommodation,
the brothers and their friend retired
for the night; and, on the following forenoon,
William mounted his horse and rode over to
the Sawyers' run, to satisfy his curiosity with
regard to the Sawyer paterfamilias.</p>

</div>

<p>William leisurely followed the track of the
Sawyers' dray for about an hour, when he
came up to their encampment, where they
had apparently fixed upon a spot for their
station. They must have been early in their
departure from Fern Vale, and industrious in
the interval; for, at the moment of William's
arrival, they had got up a tent, under which
they had placed the loading from their dray;
while, amongst the various packages, the fair
Hebe of the previous night was to be seen
busily plunging, tugging, and sorting. Already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
pegs were placed at various distances in
the ground to point out the boundaries for
their respective enclosures and establishments;
and a large tree lay stretched on the sward,
in the spot on which it had fallen when
succumbing to the axe of the younger Sawyer.
The paternal couple were engaged dissecting
the monster in sections of about nine longitudinal
feet, and were plying the cross-cut
saw with a will; while the son was driving an
iron wedge into one of the lengths, thus
dissected, to split it up into slabs for the
erection of their hut.</p>

<p>William had approached close to this industrious
family, before their attention was
diverted from their work by a knowledge of
his presence; and the old man raising his
head from his stooping posture, as the saw
cut through the log, greeted him with a
"good morning," that was echoed by the
group.</p>

<p>"There, old woman," said her husband,
"you can go help Mary Ann in the tent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
and I'll go on splitting with Reuben. Well,
young un," said he, turning to William, "yon
chap at your place, last night, I guess was a
parson; he wanted to give me a sermon, but
I didn't see it, so I cut it short; what does
he do there with you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," replied William, "he is merely
a friend of ours, and only came to the station
with me yesterday; he is a kind-hearted excellent
man, and I am sure whatever he would
have said to you would have been sound
advice."</p>

<p>"Oh, I never doubt him," said the other,
"only I don't like those parsons, and never
get into any arguments with them; whatever
you say they twist so to suit their own ways
and sayings. Who would ever have thought
that he would have said that fellow, as I was
a talking of, was any better for a blackguarding
of me for offering him of my grog."</p>

<p>"What were the particulars of that story?"
enquired William, "you did not tell us last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
night."</p>

<p>"Well, if you wants to hear it," replied
Sawyer, "I don't mind having a pull at my
pipe for a few minutes while I tell you."</p>

<p>"I would like exceedingly to hear," replied
William. Whereupon the old man took his
seat upon the log he had been splitting; filled
his pipe and lit it; while Rueben was resting
on his maul, and William, who had affixed the
bridle of his horse to the stirrup, and allowed
him to graze about the spot, took his seat at
the old man's side. After ejecting from his
mouth a volume of smoke he commenced the
following narrative; which, for the sake of
perspicuity, we will take the liberty of clothing
in our own words.</p>

<p>Old Sawyer was "an old lag," and had
been a long time in servitude (and afterwards
in freedom) on the Hunter river. During
the latter part of his career in that district
he had been pretty successful as a farmer,
and had accumulated some little means; but
agriculture, in his opinion, ceasing to be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
profitable occupation he had determined to
turn to squatting; and had consequently sold
his farm, and taken up the run on which he
was then settling. It is of his early career,
however, that we have at present to speak.</p>

<p>At a primary era of his penal servitude
he was, in common with most of his class,
assigned to a master in the district in which
he was located; and, after a time, was made
by his master an overseer over the other
servants. Amongst those under his supervision,
were two young men who had held
some posts of trust in England, and either
from some fraudulent delinquencies, or culpable
dereliction of duty, had made themselves
amenable to the then stringent laws
of their country, and were transported to the
penal colony. They were both men of education
and gentlemanly bearing; and, from a
life in a clerical appointment, they were both
totally unused to manual labour, and unfit to
grapple with the trials of the convict discipline.
They were, consequently, awkward and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
clumsy in the performance of their allotted
tasks; while their inability was construed, by
their truculent master, into perversity and
stubbornness; and he swore, by increased toil
and exactions, to break their gentlemanly
pride, as he termed their unskillfulness.</p>

<p>The two young men were put on one occasion,
by the direction of the master, to fell some
large trees, and they were given a cross-cut
saw for the purpose; but on the first tree, on
which they tried their hands, they broke their
saw. As soon as the circumstance became
known to their employer, he sent them to the
magistrate; and had them sentenced to fifty
lashes each for insubordination; and, after the
execution of the sentence, to be sent back to
work. They returned to their work, but from
that moment they were altered men. The
crushing influence of the convict system had
done its work; they had undergone the
demoniacal transition; and two more victims
were added to that mass who breathed only
for vengeance on their tyrants. It was during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
the period between this punishment, and the
accomplishment of their vengeance, that
Sawyer, who really pitied the poor fellows,
had given the bibulous invitation, and met
with the rebuff.</p>

<p>Not long after this, the two convicts made
their escape, and took to the bush; which was
scoured for months, over an immense extent,
for their recovery, but ineffectually. Nothing
was heard of them for nearly two years, when
one, famished and emaciated, gave himself up
at the settlement; reported the death of his
companion; and confessed to the participation
in one of the most horrible crimes on record;
that which we are about to relate.</p>

<p>About six months after the escape of himself
and his companion, when it was supposed
they had perished in the wilds of the bush,
the man whom we have mentioned as their
master was suddenly missed. Upon instituting
a search his body was found; but in
such as state of putrefaction, and presenting
such a hideous spectacle, that it was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
removed; but a hole dug at the spot where
it was discovered, and the remains, like any
other vile carcass, shovelled into its last
resting-place. The event at the time was
thought of little moment, as the man was
generally detested, and had no friends to
agitate the matter; so it was hardly conjectured
who were the perpetrators of his murder,
and not until the criminal himself had confessed
to the crime, were the authorities at all
acquainted with the matter.</p>

<p>It appeared that the young men, when they
effected their escape, secreted themselves in
gullies and crevices of the rocks; only venturing
out in search of food during the darkness
of night. In this way they existed; enduring
the greatest privations, and living only
for the hope of revenge. They waited for the
opportunity that was to throw their victim
into their hands, with a patience worthy of a
better cause; and watched with an eagerness
and vigilance, almost perpetual, until the
happy moment arrived, and they possessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
themselves of the person of their late detested
master.</p>

<p>He had been returning over-land from
Sydney, and was leisurely approaching the
settlements of the Hunter, when he was
espied by the convicts. Great was their joy
at this moment; though they knew, that even
now that he was within their reach, they
would experience great difficulty in securing
him; more especially, as they were convinced
he would be armed, while they were not.
However, they determined to risk their lives
in the attempt, for his death to them was
sweeter than the preservation of their own
lives.</p>

<p>They secreted themselves, one on either
side of the road along which he had to go;
and, at the moment when he was just about
passing them, they simultaneously rushed
from their ambush; and, before he was hardly
aware of their presence, they had seized him
by the arms, dragged him from his horse, and
deprived him of the fire-arms he had had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
time to use. They then bound him, and led
him away into the bush, leaving his horse to
find its way home at pleasure.</p>

<p>The captors, after pinioning the arms of
their victim, took him through the country,
over ranges and across gullies, into the recesses
of the bush, where they had taken up
their abode; not deigning to enter into any
conversation with him by the way. He, however,
treated his captivity lightly, imagining
that they were merely removing him from the
road, to give themselves a surer opportunity
of escape when they released him. He had
no doubt but that their object was simply to
rob him; and, by withdrawing him from the
chance of assistance, they were only securing
their retreat, in the event of his returning to
arrest them after regaining his liberty. He
was therefore consoling himself that he had
very little on him to lose; and would experience
very little difficulty in finding his
way to the settlement. Very different ideas
traversed the brains of his captors; though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
they preserved a uniform taciturnity to his
jocular sallies; and, except that they well
guarded against the possibility of his escape,
they took not the slightest notice of him, and
treated him with the most marked contempt.</p>

<p>After walking thus for about two hours,
they came to a deep gully, through which
rippled a small limpid creek; on the sides of
which, and extending up the faces of the
gorge, were masses of rock piled in endless
confusion. Here they halted, and having
secured their prisoner to a tree, while one lit
a fire, the other disappeared among the rocks,
and returned with some edibles, scanty in
quantity, and mean in quality. Having with
these appeased their hunger, and quenched
their thirst at the stream; they sat down by
the fire, and conversed together in a low tone;
protracting their conclave until darkness enclosed
the scene.</p>

<p>The fears of the wretched victim were at
length aroused by these mysterious proceedings.
A horrible sensation crept over his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
mind; he felt no doubt that the convicts were
holding a consultation as to how they would
dispose of him; and he entertained a secret
suspicion, that their object was not plunder,
but murder. He still, however, argued with
himself, that they could have no object in
taking his life, by which they would gain
nothing; whereas they might enrich themselves
by robbing or ransoming him. He
therefore attempted a parley to induce terms.</p>

<p>"I say, young fellows," he shouted, "how
long are you going to keep me here? you may
as well take what I have got and let me go;
or if you demand a ransom, let me know the
amount, and provide me with pen and ink,
and I will give you a cheque on the bank in
Sydney."</p>

<p>"Silence, wretched man!" replied one of
the convicts, advancing to him and presenting
one of his own pistols at his head, "or I'll
blow out your brains; we scorn to appropriate
an article belonging to you. Even these instruments
of death shall be left with you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
when we leave you; we do not desire booty.
Your time has come, when you are called
upon to atone to man for your many iniquities:
and to-morrow you will have to account to
your God."</p>

<p>"What! you surely do not mean to kill
me?" screamed the terrified captive, in a voice
that echoed in a thousand keys through the
cavernous glen: "what have I done to deserve
death from you? I have never wronged you
to my knowledge; if I have, I will make all
the reparation in my power; but spare my
life, and I will give you whatever you
demand."</p>

<p>"'Tis useless, you dog," replied his inquisitors.
"If we desired plunder, we know you
too well to believe in promises, extracted
from you under such circumstances as these;
and we are also aware of the impossibility of
our procuring the ransom you may offer, or,
even if we got it, of enjoying it."</p>

<p>"No, by heaven!" exclaimed the frantic
wretch, "I swear to you on my soul, spare me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
my life, and I will give you whatever you
ask, one hundred, five hundred, or a thousand
pounds."</p>

<p>"Your prayers to us," replied his captors,
"are of no avail, to-morrow you die; so in the
meantime, make your peace with your Maker,
if such be possible."</p>

<p>"But why kill me?" screamed the agonized
man, "what have I done to deserve death?"</p>

<p>"Wretch! do you want a recital of your
sins?" replied his quondam servant; "have
they been so insignificant that you cannot
call any to present recollection? Are they
not rather as numerous as the hairs on your
head? does not the black and heinous catalogue
rise before you, and darken your very
soul? You have asked us why you are to
die; I will tell you, and let God judge between
us whether your fate is not your just reward;
while you, vile reptile that you are, answer if
you can, if we have not just cause to require
your death to expiate your crimes.</p>

<p>"How have you fulfilled the government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
requisitions to your assigned servants? How
have you fed them and clothed them? Have
not their coverings been such, as to be as bad
or worse than none? insufficient for any
season; causing paralysis in winter, and sun-strokes
in summer? Has not their food been
unfit for pigs? Have you not tyrannized over
them, and submitted them to unheard-of
cruelties; simply to gratify your insatiable
thirst for witnessing torture? Have you not,
when you had a willing servant, who was
anxious to conduct himself orderly and give
satisfaction, made some paltry excuse to have
the man punished; because you feared you
would lose his services, by his obtaining his
'ticket of leave,' for good conduct? Have
you not done all this? Yes! and more. You
have even compelled your men to intoxicate
themselves; and then accused them before a
magistrate of stealing the spirits, to obtain
the cancelling of their tickets. You have by
your cruelty driven men mad, to the bush, or
to a lingering death; you have crushed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
germ of contrition in the breasts of hundreds,
and degraded them to the level of beasts;
while the only sounds grateful to your ears,
have been the yells of anguish of your victims;
and the only spectacle pleasing to your
sight, the application of the lash. You have
done all this, and even more in hundreds or
thousands of cases. You have done so to us;
you have heaped ignominy upon our heads;
and with starvation, exposure, and accumulated
toil, you have caused unjustly our backs
to be lacerated by the lash, and our spirits to
be broken by your barbarity. Life to us has
lost its charm; we thirst only for your blood;
vengeance is now in our hands, and you shall
die."</p>

<p>The yells of the wretched man, that followed
this denouncement, sounded through
the glen as the shrieks of a demon or a
maniac; and his cries might have been heard
far into the bush, had there been any one near
to help him. But they were lost on the wilderness'
air; and he at last sank exhausted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
in his bonds, while his captors watched alternately
at his feet, with his own loaded pistols
ready for use in case of emergency.</p>

<p>The morning dawned as brightly as ever;
though the stillness of the bush cast a gloom
upon everything within its umbrageous influence.
The convicts were up and stirring by
daylight, and their first task was to arouse
their unconscious victim (who seemed to doze
in a lethargic indifference), and prepare him
for his approaching fate.</p>

<p>He was speedily denuded of his attire, and
bound hand and foot; in which condition he
was laid over the bed of an ant's nest, and
tied by his extremities, in a state of tension,
to opposite trees; in such a manner as to
keep his body immoveable over the nest.
The wretched man soon awoke to the horrors
of his situation, and implored, with the
earnestness of a dying man, of his murderers
to save his life. But he appealed to feelings
and sympathies that were dead; that had,
in fact, been strangled by himself: it was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
vain. After the most desperate resistance he
was secured in his place of torture, while the
very skies rang with his cries of anguish and
despair.</p>

<p>His body was no sooner prostrate on the
heap, than the ants in myriads attacked it
vigorously; in a few minutes making its
surface black with their swarms; penetrating
into his very flesh, and making use of
the natural channels to affect ingress to his
inner system; and travelling in continuous
streams in and out of his nostrils, ears, and
mouth. The horrors of the picture it is
impossible to describe; and the expression of
his features it is equally difficult to conceive.
The colour of his skin speedily changed to
deep blue; the veins and muscles stood out
in bold relief; his eyes projected from his
head, and rolled, bleared as they were, in
sockets of livid flesh; he gnashed his teeth
in his unutterable agony, and rent the air
with horrible and impious imprecations;
while the utterance was almost diabolical by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
the vermin that choked the passages of his
system.</p>

<p>No human being could long bear this
excruciating torture; and at last the body
perceptibly swelled, the c&oelig;liac or cavernous
parts becoming horribly distended, and the
spirit fled to its heavenly judgment. Not
till then, did the two calm spectators leave
the spot, where they had witnessed the death
of their victim, and where they now left
"nature's scavengers" to finish the work they
had commenced.</p>

<p>The sufferings of the two convicts from
this time must have been fearful; for one
shortly succumbed to them, while the other
bearing it for some months longer, gave himself
up to the authorities, and met his fate on
the gallows.</p>

<p>After the relation of the above tale of woe
the elder Sawyer and his son resumed their
work, and the conversation took a general
turn; while William, who found he could not
be of any service to the settlers, caught his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
horse and took his leave.</p>

<p>When he returned to his own place he
found that, during his absence, the expected
dray had arrived from town with their furniture,
which lay strewn on the ground, in
front of the cottage, where it had been discharged.
And he at once became busy in
unpacking and sorting the things; while his
brother superintended the refreighting of the
vehicle with what return loading they had
for it. The man and wife who had been
hired for them, and who had accompanied
the dray, busied themselves in arranging
the things in the cottage.</p>

<p>The proposed visit to the blacks, by this
opportune arrival, was necessarily postponed;
and it was determined that William should,
that very afternoon, ride over to Strawberry
Hill; inform Kate of the orders of things;
and desire her to join them as soon as possible.
John impressed upon his brother the necessity
of urging Kate to lose no time, as the place
would be quite ready for her by the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
day; and he did not think, under the existing
circumstances, it was consistent for her to
remain longer with the Rainsfields than was
absolutely necessary. "Of course," he said,
"Kate would be perfectly ignorant of the
rupture between myself and Mr. Rainsfield,
and might therefore battle against so speedy
and abrupt a termination to her visit." But
he left the matter, he told William, to himself
to manage, without entering into any
explanations to their sister, which would
necessarily be painful to all parties; besides
which, he had no doubt, when Mrs. Rainsfield
perceived it was his desire to have Kate home
with them, she would offer no objection to
her departure, as she would understand his
motive for desiring it.</p>

<p>William was accordingly dispatched on the
errand; and returning in the evening, in
company with Tom Rainsfield, gave an account
of his diplomacy. As was anticipated
by the brothers, Kate could with difficulty be
persuaded to break off her engagement with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
the Rainsfields; but that when she saw that
both her brothers desired it, and that she was
not pressed to prolong her visit, she reluctantly
acceded to her brother's request; and
promised to be ready to come over to Fern
Vale on the following morning. So William
had engaged to return for her the next day.</p>

<p>"It is lucky for you, my fine friend," said
Tom, "that I was not at home, when you
persuaded your sister to such an ungracious
determination; for I, most assuredly, would
have annihilated you, and kept her in captivity.
It is really cruel just to leave her
with us sufficiently long to cause us all to
adore her; and then snatch her away from
us in such an unceremonious manner. What
on earth can you mean by carrying her off in
this way?"</p>

<p>"Why," said John, "we are afraid of losing
sight of you altogether, Tom; you would have
forgotten us entirely while you retained
possession of our Kate; and besides we want
to make some use of our idle little sister. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
tell us now, if you were not at home when
William was at your house, pray, where did
you spring from?"</p>

<p>"I have been over to the black's camp, to
try and conciliate the rascals," replied Tom,
"but I am sorry to find they are death on my
brother for his treatment of them."</p>

<p>"You seem to have agitated them by your
visit," said John, "for they have made a fearful
disturbance all the afternoon."</p>

<p>"They were holding some discussion when
I arrived there," said Tom, "but they were
quieted upon my presenting myself."</p>

<p>"They appear then only to have been
'called to order' by you," said John, "and
maintained it simply during your stay; for
did you ever hear such a Babel of voices as
are screaming now; it is enough to deafen
us even at this distance."</p>

<p>When Mr. Rainsfield parted from Mr.
Billing, after escorting him to the junction of
the Alma and Brompton roads, he returned
home to carry out his contemplated arrangements;
in the concatenation of which, his
first step was to remove the stores from the
building used as a store to an apartment in
the house; and he had barely effected this,
before Tom, his wife, and Kate returned.
When the ladies retired in the evening Tom
asked his brother if John Ferguson had been
at Strawberry Hill in the morning; and how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
it was that he had not been seen by any
other inmate of the house.</p>

<p>Rainsfield replied that John Ferguson had
certainly been there in the morning; and
that the cause of his not having been seen by
the family was an interview that had taken
place between himself and Ferguson by which
he, Mr. Rainsfield, had learnt that the blacks
were meditating some fresh outrage; and he
would therefore be glad if Tom would undertake
a mission to them to mediate a pacification.</p>

<p>Rainsfield was playing a deep and hazardous
game, and he felt it himself. Even to his
brother he had recourse to dissimulation to
blind or divert him from a perception of a
stratagem in which he was aware he could
not procure Tom's concurrence. He therefore
wished to get him out of the way while he
worked his diabolical machinations. He
knew that whatever the purpose of the blacks
might be, they would not be diverted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
the persuasion of Tom; and, as he naturally
conceived their object to be pilfering, he
intended to be perfectly prepared for them.
At the same time he wished none of his
own family to witness the preparations he
was making.</p>

<p>"Very well," said Tom, "I will go to-morrow;
for, to tell you the truth, I have
myself thought for some time that they were
hatching some mischief; and my suspicions
were the more aroused when I witnessed,
along with John Ferguson, their last corroboree.
It struck me then, more than once,
that I heard your name uttered by them in
their song."</p>

<p>"Were you then at the corroboree?"
enquired Rainsfield.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Tom. "But tell me what
information John Ferguson imparted to you,
and how he obtained it."</p>

<p>"Well, I can hardly tell you now," said
Rainsfield, "for I was so agitated at the time
that much of it was lost to me; but I believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
he said his blacks boys, who had returned
from the camp after the corroboree, had informed
him that the tribe intended something;
though what the exact nature of the meditated
aggression was, they were unable or unwilling
to explain."</p>

<p>On the following day Rainsfield was
anxious to get Tom off before the arrival of
Billing, whose absence he had not perceived.
And he wished, if possible, to prevent the
necessity of accounting for the storekeeper's
journey to Alma; the very circumstance of
which, unusual as it was, he knew would
excite the wonder of Tom. While, if not
perfectly satisfied with his explanation, he
feared his brother might be induced to seek
further information from Mrs. Billing; whom
Rainsfield felt no doubt was a confident of
her husband, and acquainted with the object
of the journey, at least such object as was
assigned to it by himself. So he urged upon
Tom the advisableness of dispatch, to prevent
the blacks from carrying out their plans, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
they meditated anything that night.</p>

<p>Tom promised to go about mid-day, or
early in the afternoon, and to stop with them
until late in the evening, so as to detain them,
if they meditated any outrage on the station,
from its execution; and about one o'clock he
took his departure, much to the relief of his
brother. Not long afterwards the horse that
was supposed to be carrying the burden of
Mr. Billing's body presented himself at the
door of the house, though minus his rider.
The valise was instantly removed by Mr.
Rainsfield, who perceived that the desired
articles were therein; and he then dispatched
one of his men, with the horse, to go back
and look for the missing equestrian; without
allowing the sensitive nerves of that doating
creature, the sharer of all his earthly troubles,
to be unnecessarily agitated by a knowledge
of her husband's abasement.</p>

<p>The rider was not long in returning with
the lost representative of commerce, who had
in the agony of his motion, and in a futile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
effort to stop the career of his carrier, lost his
balance in his saddle, and described what in
skating counties is designated a "spread
eagle." He, however, found himself less hurt
than he at first anticipated, and he speedily
adopted a sensible resolution to make the best
progress he could on foot. While the horse,
after relieving himself of his encumbrance,
and getting beyond the reach of capture,
must have taken his leisure, for Mr. Billing
was no very great distance behind him.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Billing," said his master, as that
individual addressed made his appearance in
a sorry plight, "how did you enjoy your
excursion to Alma? I am sorry to see you
have got thrown; I trust you have not hurt
yourself."</p>

<p>"I am happy, sir, to assure you," replied
Mr. Billing, "that, through the gracious dispensation
of Providence, I have sustained no
osseous fractures; though, sir, I may add, my
mental agony, and bodily sufferings, have
been such as I never wish again to experience."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>"You must expect to have some inconvenience
in your first ride, Mr. Billing,"
said his master; "but you will find, upon
your second attempt, that the unpleasantness
will be diminished."</p>

<p>"That second attempt, sir," replied the
little man, "will never be made by me. I
have a positive abhorrence for a horse, sir, and
no power on earth, sir, would induce me to
become a chevalier."</p>

<p>"Very well, Mr. Billing," replied the other,
"I'll not attempt to persuade you against
your own inclinations; I can only thank you
for your services on this occasion, and if you
will meet me in the store, when you have
recovered yourself a little, we will proceed to
business;" saying which, the couple parted.</p>

<p>In the store where Rainsfield entered were,
besides sundry articles that were not strictly
alimentary, the carcass of a sheep, suspended
from one of the beams, and a bag of flour; or
rather a bag that had contained flour, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
bag was suspended supinely by two ropes,
with its mouth open; and on a sheet on the
floor was heaped the flour it had contained.
To this heap, after closing and locking the
door, Rainsfield advanced; and, first taking a
furtive glance around, to satisfy himself that
he was unnoticed, he stooped down and deliberately
mixed with it the arsenic that had been
brought by Mr. Billing. He had performed
this operation, and had just rebagged the flour,
when Billing turned the handle of the door,
at the sound of which Rainsfield started like
a detected thief.</p>

<p>At no time are the words of the immortal
bard, "thus conscience doth make cowards of
us all," more forcibly displayed than when an
honourable or upright man steps from the
straight path of honour and integrity to perform
a despicable or criminal action. Thus
Mr. Rainsfield could not quiet the chidings of
his conscience, which did not disguise from
him the enormity of the crime he was committing;
and when he heard the step of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
storekeeper at the door he felt the weight of
contemplated guilt, and for some moments
had not the power of articulation.</p>

<p>Mr. Billing was just turning away, thinking
his master was not in the building, when Mr.
Rainsfield opened the door with a blush on his
cheek, and a lie in his mouth, to support his
first deception and subsequent interruption.</p>

<p>"I hardly heard you, Mr. Billing," said he,
"when you tried the door, as I was busy, and
I had locked it to prevent being disturbed.
You see," he continued, as his confidential
entered, "I have had a sheep killed for our
purpose. This we will now inoculate with
the strychnine you have procured; and we
will send it out to the plains for the dogs to
consume to-morrow; and we can continue the
operation at frequent intervals until the
animals disappear. The arsenic, I think, we
may keep for the present, and see first how
this acts. You will perceive I have removed
all the stores into the house with the exception
of this one bag of flour, which I discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
to be slightly damaged, so had it
sifted. I was just packing it again as you
came to the door, and being so much occupied
I did not hear you. By the way," he repeated
to himself, "I may as well close it up;"
and turning to Billing, he resumed: "will you
be good enough to step into the house and get
me a needle and string?"</p>

<p>Mr. Billing went for the required articles,
and during his absence, Rainsfield removed
the sheet on which the flour had been spread,
and destroyed all traces of his labour; so that,
upon Billing's return, the work, or that portion
of it, was accomplished, and the bag was
placed in an upright position against the wall.</p>

<p>The sheep was then removed from the
beam, and the inside was well rubbed and
besmeared with the poison; after which it was
placed in its former position, and the outside
submitted to a similar manipulation. This
completed the pair left the store; the door
was locked by the master, and the key taken
away by him to prevent, as he said, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
possibility of accidents.</p>

<p>"Do you not think," suggested Mr. Billing,
"we had better have the flour removed into
the house?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, it does not signify to-day," replied
Rainsfield, "it will take no harm there until
the morning, and we can have it removed
then when we send the fellows up to the
plains with the meat."</p>

<p>In the meantime Tom took his way to the
blacks' camp, where he found a large number
of the tribe collected; and all in apparent
agitation. He at once perceived that some
event was about to take place, and he conjectured
that what was intended was a sortie on
his brother's station. The men were mostly
standing before the entrances to their "gunyahs,"
facing one another in the circular
enclosure; and carrying on a united disputation
at the highest pitch of their voices, all at
one and the same time. They were supported
occasionally by the opinions of the gins,
which, though volunteered by those soft, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
not fair creatures, were, as is usually the case
even with their civilized contemporaries,
totally unheeded by their lords; who continued
their ratiocination with unabated
ardour. Whatever was the nature of the discussion
in progress, it ceased as Tom rode
into the midst of the disputants; and to the
sound of the human hubbub succeeded that
of the canine, which, but for the reverence
the blacks had for their dogs, Tom would
have silenced by knocking the brains out of
a score of the brutes. He, however, resisted
the temptation, and made his way straight up
to the abode of the chief, dismounted, fastened
his horse to a tree, and advanced to the sable
scoundrel with a smile; which was returned
by a malignant scowl. This was not lost
upon Tom, though he pretended not to have
seen it; and, as he sat down upon a log in
front of Dugingi, and lit his pipe from a fire-stick,
he said:</p>

<p>"Well, Dugingi, what are you up to
now? I see you have got something in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
wind."</p>

<p>A grunt was the only answer he got to this
query; but he pushed his enquiries and
demanded: "Are you going to pay us another
visit at Strawberry Hill, Dugingi?" Still he
elicited no information, and began to be
rather disgusted.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to answer me at all, you
black thief?" he exclaimed; "see here! if you
won't be civil and open your mouth beyond
those grunts, I'll break your head." And he
raised the heavy riding-whip he carried, as he
spoke, in an attitude of menace that made
the black shrink to the entrance of his gunyah.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Mister Tom?" said
Jemmy Davies, who came up at this juncture,
"why are you 'riled?' Has Dugingi been
saying anything to you?"</p>

<p>"No, Jemmy, it is because the wretch won't
speak that I am put out. I have asked him
what is the cause of this uproar; and what
he is up to with the tribe; and the brute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
won't utter a word, but only answers me with
grunts. I am of a good mind to treat him to
a sound thrashing for his insolence; but you
tell me, Jemmy, what you are after here?"</p>

<p>"Nothing particular, sir," replied the black;
"some of our fellows are kicking up a row,
and they won't be quiet."</p>

<p>"Well, what are they kicking up the row
about, Jemmy?"</p>

<p>"One feller said, that another feller hit the
other feller's gin, because the gin beat the
other feller's gin's piccanini."</p>

<p>"Well," said Tom, "that is a very lucid
explanation of the subject of discussion in
your conclave, Jemmy; but I strongly suspect
it is not strictly true. Now, tell me, were you
not hatching some mischief against us?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, 'pon my honour," exclaimed
Jemmy Davies, "we never thought of such a
thing."</p>

<p>"Now, it's no use telling that to me," cried
Tom, "I am confident you were; and I know
you have been thinking of it for some time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
Were you not talking about it in your last
corroboree; and was not this talk to-day the
continuation of the plot? You may as well
confess it to me, for I know it all; you intend
my brother some injury."</p>

<p>"Well, sir," replied the black, "suppose we
were talking about Mr. Rainsfield we would
not hurt you."</p>

<p>"I am not at all afraid of your hurting
me," exclaimed Tom; "for it's short work I'd
make of a score of you, if you were to try
any violence to me; but why annoy my
brother?"</p>

<p>"You see, sir," replied Jemmy, "we all like
you, because you are good to the black fellows;
but your brother is bad to us, and the tribe
hate him. They would not kill him because
he never killed any of them; but they still
hate him and take his rations."</p>

<p>"That's it!" said Tom; "it is just because
you steal his rations that he is so severe on
you; if you had not molested us, he would
not have molested you; but we are obliged to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
keep you away, because you have made yourselves
dangerous. Why don't you behave
yourselves to us, the same as you do to the
Fergusons? and we wouldn't prevent you
coming to the station; but if you persist in
stealing I am afraid my brother will some
day be disposed to shoot some of you."</p>

<p>"We don't interfere with Mr. Ferguson,"
replied Jemmy Davies, "because he is good
to us; and I have told you the reason why
we hate Mr. Rainsfield is because he is bad
to us. I don't believe the tribe would ever
like him now however good he would be."</p>

<p>"Will you just try and persuade them,
Jemmy, to be a little more civil," said Tom,
"and depend upon me to get you justice. It
is of no use our always living like this; and
you may be sure my brother will shoot some
of you if you continue to steal. Tell me
now the truth; are you thinking of robbing
us again?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied the black, "don't you
believe it. Some of them want to, and some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
do not; I don't; I will try and keep the
others back."</p>

<p>"That's right, Jemmy," exclaimed Tom,
"exert yourself, for depend upon it it will
be better for you, and the tribe too, to remain
friendly to us."</p>

<p>Tom Rainsfield had some confidence in,
not only the word of Jemmy Davies, but also
in his influence with the tribe; and therefore
believed the ingenuous story the black told
of the animated discussion; his refusal to acquiesce
in the meditated theft; and his desire
to deter the others from its committal. He
therefore felt relieved in his mind for the
time being; and determined to impress upon
his brother the necessity, for his own security,
of adopting some lenient measures towards
the blacks. In this train of thought, and
accompanied by Jemmy Davies, he left the
camp, and returned to the crossing-place of
the river, where he parted with his companion,
after obtaining a re-assurance from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
him that no outrage would be committed with
his concurrence.</p>

<p>Tom, after crossing the Gibson, and directing
his steps homewards, fell in with William
Ferguson, returning from Strawberry Hill,
and was easily persuaded to accompany him
and remain the night at Fern Vale; where,
in the meantime, we will leave him to revert
to Mr. Rainsfield and his expected visitors.</p>

<p>After he left the store with Billing Mr.
Rainsfield gave particular instructions that
the flocks should be well watched; and he
anxiously waited for the approach of night.
When the family retired to rest he found
some excuse to detain him in the sitting-room;
and, wondering at the protracted stay of his
brother, he paced the room with a disordered
step and agitated mind. He desired to see
Tom back, to hear his report, and see him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
retire to his bed; but he waited in vain;
while the idea never occurred to him of the
probability of his going over to the Fergusons.
He, however, as the night grew on, extinguished
the light in the room; and, the night
being pitch dark, sat with the French light
open, with his eyes and ears strained to their
fullest distention to catch the appearance
of any moving object, or any sound in the
direction of the store.</p>

<p>He had remained thus until past midnight
when he thought he detected the sound of
voices uttered in a low cadence; and he
strained his auricular organs so as to endeavour
to catch some convincing proof of the
proximity of his victims. Again the same
sound struck him. It must be the voices of
the blacks, thought he. "It is, by heaven!
they are here," he mentally exclaimed, as their
subdued conversation (which could plainly be
distinguished in the still night air) was again
heard. He was not long either before he
had ocular demonstration of their approach;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
for round the corner of the store, he could
discern, through the obscurity, the dusky form
of a black stealthily and cautiously creeping.</p>

<p>The vision, however, was only transitory,
for in a moment Rainsfield lost sight of the
figure, and believing that the fellow's mission
might have been to steal up to the house, and
reconnoitre while his confederates were effecting
an entrance to the store, he all but closed
the window; though he still kept his eyes
and ears on the alert through the aperture.
Again his ears caught a sound: "ah! the
fellow's trying the door," he muttered; "perhaps
you would like the key, my friends?
However, I suppose you won't allow yourselves
to be disappointed by a trifle of a lock; burst
it open," he continued, "no one will hear you.
Ah! there you are again! back to your companions,
practised burglar! I suppose your
confederates keep in the background, while
you try the premises. You are quite safe;
I'll guarantee you shan't be disturbed this
time. Get in any way you like, but don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
burn the place."</p>

<p>Such were the mental ejaculations of the
proprietor of Strawberry Hill, as he continued
at the window of his sitting-room, holding
open a leaf in each hand, and gazing with
breathless attention at the quarter where the
late apparition momentarily disappeared; and
with intense anxiety did he continue to pierce
the darkness, in the hope of witnessing a reappearance
of the nocturnal visitant. Nor
had he to wait long to be gratified; for
presently a similar object showed itself at
the point which was the focus of Rainsfield's
gaze; and almost immediately after another,
and another; and then the obscurely luminous
passage was perfectly darkened with human
forms.</p>

<p>This incident was not lost on Rainsfield;
he saw at once that the blacks were determined
to effect their purpose; and he secretly
indulged in a fiendish gratulation at the pertinacity
with which they were throwing themselves
into his trap. "Ah!" said he, continuing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
his meditations, "you are in force are you?
why, you must have your whole tribe with
you. Well now, how are you going to manage
your business? hark! surely that must be the
door unlocked; yes! there the hinges creak!
Well, you beauties, you have done that
cleverly." So he continued to cogitate, and
watch the progress of his scheme's effect, till
the dark forms of the sable thieves could be
discerned evidently treading on each other's
heels, while they bore off their purloined prize.
Desirous as he was to satisfy himself whether
or not they had decamped with the poisoned
meat and flour, he dared not venture out for
fear that some of their number lurked about
the station to cover the retreat of their
friends; and not until he heard from the
distance the call of the blacks vibrating in
the bush did he consider himself safe to
examine his own premises.</p>

<p>He crept from his ambush with as much
stealth as the thieves had approached his own
property; his heart beating almost audibly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
and his eyes glancing furtively around him,
attempting to pierce the darkness; while he
started at the sighing of the faintest breath;
shrinking at the sound of his own footsteps,
and conjuring the wildest phantasies in the
midnight air. Conscience was at its work,
and he felt already the hot blast of guilt searing
his very soul.</p>

<p>He approached the store; the door was
open; he entered; the darkness seemed
doubly dark, and nothing could be distinguished
in the internal gloom. He mechanically
went to the spot where he had left the
bag of flour; groped with his hands about
the wall and on the floor, and found it gone.
He walked across the room, with his arms
extended in such a manner as to come in contact
with the suspended carcass if it had been
there; but he found it gone also; and when
he had satisfied himself upon that point, his
arms dropt to his side, while he stood musing
in the middle of the building.</p>

<p>"So they have robbed me again, have they?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
he muttered; "well, they will have to answer
for their own deaths; it is their own voluntary
action." Conscience, however, refused to be
silenced by such sophistry, and, as the homicide
wrapt himself in his self-justification,
startled him from his quietude by uttering in
the still small voice, "Thou shalt not kill."
The effect of the rebuke was but momentary,
for the man argues: "I do not kill them, they
kill themselves. Surely I may poison meat for
the extermination of vermin; and how more
securely can I keep it than under lock and
key? Then if they steal it and eat it, and
meet their death in consequence, surely no
blame can be attached to me."</p>

<p>"Thou shalt not kill," still urged the silent
monitor; "thou knewest well the poisoned
food would be stolen by the ignorant savages,
and thou didst poison it for that purpose."</p>

<p>"But if the villains persisted in stealing
what was poisoned," urged the guilty man,
"they commit the crime of theft; and thereby
evoke the punishment in the death which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
follows. The fact of its being poisoned involves
no criminality on the part of the
owner, because the property is surreptitiously
acquired; thereby relieving him of any
participation in their death by the fact of its
means being obtained, not only without his
sanction, but in violation of his precautions
to preserve it. If," continued the mental
disputant, "I had given them the meat intentionally
to destroy them, then would I
have been guilty; but having placed it in
what I believed a perfect security, the blacks
having voluntarily rushed upon their doom,
am I to be blamed? Did not Achan, when
he appropriated of the spoils of Jericho, meet
with the just reward of his disobedience in
his death?"</p>

<p>"Thou shalt not kill," repeated conscience;
"and God hateth false lips, 'he that speaketh
lies shall perish.' Thou knewest the blacks
would steal the meat, notwithstanding your
boasted security of it; and, moreover, thou
didst desire that they should. Their death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
will not be upon their own heads, notwithstanding
that they meet it through the
committal of a sin. Their sin they commit
in ignorance, and God only shall judge them
of it; thou takest their life knowingly,
meanly, and cowardly, and God shall judge
you for it. Achan met his death by the
command of the omnipotent Judge, for the
disobedience of the divine command; while
your victims have no conception of their
infringement of any law. Dost thou remember
the judgments that fell upon David
for the murder of Uriah? Your act is far
more atrocious than his; for with him, the
victim was one, and might have been said to
have been through the fortunes of war; while
your victims are many, and are murdered in
a cold-blooded way, to screen you from the
laws of your country, and the opinions of
men. Heavy is the curse on him who
sheddeth man's blood, and verily the curse
of the Lord will smite thee, thou worker of
iniquity. If thou desirest not their death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
hasten now after them, and prevent them
from eating of the food."</p>

<p>"They would not believe me if I told them
it was poisoned," argued conscience's opponent,
"but would simply imagine that I was
endeavouring to recover my property."</p>

<p>"Offer them other for it, or tell them to try
it first on their dogs," suggested conscience.</p>

<p>"I dare not show myself to them at all," replied
the man; "I believe they would kill me
if I did; besides, if they choose to poison themselves
let them. It is no business of mine to
prevent them; they have long been a source
of annoyance to me, and no one can blame me
for their death. No jury in the world would
convict me of murder; then why should I
fear? Is not self-preservation the first law of
nature? and is not a man perfectly justified
in adopting any measure to preserve his life
and his property. If I am to be taxed with the
death of these wretches, whose riddance from
the earth will be an inestimable blessing to the
district and civilisation, no one would be justified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
in killing an attempted assassin or a burglar;
and a landowner, who sets spring-guns
for the protection of his preserves, becomes a
murderer if his instruments of destruction take
effect. In fact the law itself has no right to
exercise its jurisdiction in the disposal of life;
and the execution of a condemned criminal is
nothing more than a forensic murder. But why
need I allow my morbid fancies or sympathetic
feelings to overcome justice and my own
judgment, or frighten me into a belief that I
am committing a sin? No! if it be necessary,
I will blazon the matter to the world, and let
my fellow-men judge me; and I am convinced
I will be exonerated from all criminality."</p>

<p>Conscience was stifled for the time; and
Rainsfield left the store, taking care to leave
the place precisely as it was vacated by the
blacks; and as the first gray streaks rose
above the horizon, heralding Aurora's approach,
he returned to the house as cautiously as he
left it; entering by the open window of the
sitting-room, and seeking his bed to sleep the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
troubled sleep of a disquieted mind.</p>

<p>At an early hour of the morning, as Mr. Billing
resumed his daily vocations, the robbery
on the store was discovered; and the intelligence
was speedily communicated by that individual
to his master, who affected the utmost
surprise at the theft, and the deepest
concern at the inevitable fate of the wretched
aborigines. "Poor creatures," he exclaimed,
"I would not have cared for the loss of the
rations; but to think that the poor deluded
beings are unconsciously the instruments of
their own deaths, through the gratification of
their own cupidity, is truly melancholy. I
am vexed at myself for leaving the meat in the
store, for now I see it was the most likely place
where it would be molested. I would give anything
to save them; what can be done, Mr.
Billing? can they be warned of their danger
before it is too late? I would not for worlds
that the poor wretches should be poisoned,
even though it were through the consumption
of stolen food, and, notwithstanding the thorn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
they have been in my side; I wish Tom were
here. Speak, Mr. Billing, what can be done?"</p>

<p>Shall we say that this philanthropic consideration
for the poor ignorant blacks was
the spontaneous ebullition of a genuine contrition;
or a mere verbose eruption of assumed
sympathy, studied and expressed with the
view of disarming suspicion of the sheep being
intentionally poisoned and placed in the store as
a trap? Without wishing to be harsh or uncharitable,
we must conscientiously express our
fears that the latter was the case; and that
Rainsfield's apparent sorrow for the fate of
his victims was a predetermined link of his
scheme.</p>

<p>"I fear nothing can be done, sir," replied Mr.
Billing to the query of his master; "they have
evidently been possessed of their booty, sir,
some hours; and, doubtless, by this time it is
consumed. I cannot venture, sir, to suggest
any remedy; and would merely recommend
that until we are aware, sir, of the extent of the
evil, you would not allow, sir, the circumstance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
to prey too much on your mind."</p>

<p>"Do you not think, my dear sir," said
Rainsfield, "some good might be done by
sending some one over to warn them of their
danger?"</p>

<p>Instant visions of his late journey occurred
to the mind of Mr. Billing; and when he
hastily replied, "no, sir, I really think it can
be of no service," he might have been under
the impression that it was the intention of
his master to send him as the warning messenger
he alluded to. "I assure you, sir," he
repeated, "it can be of no use; for as I have
already stated, sir, I believe that ere this the
whole of the provisions have been consumed."</p>

<p>"But tell me, Billing," enquired the suddenly
created philanthropist, "how was the
store entered? because I imagined, that having
locked it, it was perfectly secure."</p>

<p>"It appeared, sir," replied Mr. Billing, "that
the cunning scoundrels, when they discovered
the door to be secure, managed, sir, to wrench
one of the slabs out of the back; and from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
the inside, after effecting an entrance by that
means, they opened the door, sir, for their
greater convenience, and decamped; performing
the whole so noiselessly, sir, that even I
who was in their vicinity was not disturbed.
And, sir, both Mrs. Billing and myself are
extremely uneasy in our rest. I can assure
you, sir, the slightest noise is likely to arouse
either of us. I remember on one occasion, sir
(if you will permit me to make an observation
on my private experience?), before my evil
genius prompted me to break up, sir, my pleasant
and comfortable little home in the mother
country, to seek my fortunes, sir, in this inhospitable
land, I resided, as I believe I have already
informed you, sir, in the genteel suburban
neighbourhood of Brixton. My means
then, sir, enabled me to possess some of the
luxuries of life, of which a cheerful and comfortable
home, sir, I believe to be not the least.
However, upon one occasion, sir, when Mrs.
Billing and I had retired to rest; for we were
early people, Mr. Rainsfield, very early people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
and had a strong objection to late hours;
believing, sir, that they destroy the constitution,
without imparting any satisfaction
commensurate to the loss. Well, sir, as I
observed, we had retired early to rest one
evening; and the reigning stillness of the
house, sir, was hardly broken by the musical
voice of my wife. I will do her the justice
to remark, sir, that she is a sensible woman, a
very sensible woman, sir; notwithstanding
that she was treating me on that occasion, to
a little dissertation on her system of housekeeping;
though I would have you distinctly
to understand, sir, not in a style of eloquence
peculiar to that good lady, Mrs. Caudle. That,
Mr. Rainsfield, is not one of my wife's idiosyncrasies;
but she prided herself upon her
domestic economy, and she was making a
voluntary explanation of her expenditure;
while I was dozing under the influence of her
soporific lullaby. My spirit would have
speedily fled to the land of dreams had not
my sense of hearing, sir, detected a sound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
that was inimical to our peace, and I started
erect in my bed, sir, with my forefinger
raised to Mrs. B. to enjoin silence; while I
listened with an ardent attention.</p>

<p>"'What on earth is the matter, James?'
exclaimed my wife, sir, 'you quite frightened
me; what made you start in such an extraordinary
manner.'</p>

<p>"'Don't you hear anything, my love?'
replied I; 'can't your quick ear detect sounds
that portend to an unpleasant visitation?'</p>

<p>"'No,' she replied, sir, 'what do you mean,
James? what sounds?'</p>

<p>"'The sounds of the housebreaker,' I replied,
'attempting to violate the sanctity of our
dwelling. Are you so deaf, my love,' I said,
'that you cannot hear the regular grating of a
saw at work on some of our doors or shutters?'</p>

<p>"'I can certainly hear some sound,' she
replied, 'but it is only the gnawing of a rat,
or a mouse in the wainscot of the room; rest
your mind easy, James,' she continued, 'no
thieves would think it worth their while to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
molest us.'</p>

<p>"'I am not so sure of that, my dear,' I replied;
'but, even if I were, do you imagine
that I would lie dormantly in my bed (while
I was convinced some nocturnal villain was
attempting to enter my premises), perhaps to
see the wife of my bosom murdered in cold
blood before my very eyes, and possibly have
my own throat cut afterwards to complete
the tragedy?'</p>

<p>"My apprehensions were not entertained
by my wife, sir, for she urged me to lie down.
'Do not frighten yourself at nothing,' she
exclaimed, 'and alarm me so at your dreadful
imageries; allow me to convince you it is all
fancy; besides if thieves tried to get in, all
the places are too well secured for them to
gain an entrance.'</p>

<p>"'Ah, my wife!' said I, 'there you show
your inexperience; a practised housebreaker
would not be deterred by the presence of
bars, bolts, or locks; the greater the supposed
security, the greater are the chances of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
success; besides while my suspicions are
aroused, I could not rest until I had satisfied
myself that they are groundless, and that is
speedily done. So I am determined to see;'
with which I got out of bed, and with many
cautions from my wife, in the event of my
discovering any thieves, not to venture into
danger or to allow myself, sir, in my indignation,
or courage, to be exposed to
either the ruffians or the night air, I hastily
threw some clothes over me to guard against
the risk of catching cold; for I was always
susceptible to cold, sir. I quietly crept down
stairs, sir, and the sound that greeted my
ears distinctly proclaimed the fact that the
thieves, sir, were at their nefarious work.
When I reached the passage I perceived, sir,
they were not at the front door; so, hastily
entering the parlour and convincing myself,
sir, that they were not there, I seized a poker
for my personal protection, and descended,
sir, towards the basement of the house. As I
turned for this purpose, sir, the sound which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
had momentarily ceased, now recommenced,
and I could detect it, sir, almost in my very
presence. It was at a door leading into our
garden and back premises, and in the indistinct
light of the spot, I had almost said
total darkness, sir, I perceived a saw at work
cutting through the panel of the door. It
was being industriously plied, sir, by some one
on the outside, and at the time of my arrival,
sir, had almost completed its work of extracting
a piece sufficiently large to allow a
man's arm to be thrust through, by which
means I imagine, sir, the operator intended to
unfasten the door. However, sir, the instrument,
which I discovered was of a tender
description, I snapped asunder with one blow,
sir, of the weapon I held in my hand; and,
with as truculent a voice as I could assume,
informed my visitors, sir, that unless they
instantly decamped, I would fire on them.
My interruption to their proceedings, sir, was
hailed with a volley of combined expletives;
after the utterance of which, sir, I had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
satisfaction of distinctly hearing the sounds
of their retreating footsteps, and could see
from one of my back windows, to which I
had removed to prospect, two ill-favoured
looking rascals clambering over the garden
wall. So, sir, if it had not been for my
quickness of hearing on that occasion, I
should of a certainty have been robbed,
and most probably murdered."</p>

<p>"You certainly made a happy escape, Mr.
Billing," said Rainsfield, after listening, or
appearing to listen, to this episode in the
history of his storekeeper; "but I regret your
hearing did not render you much service on
this occasion, and surely the blacks, to have
taken out one of the slabs in the store, must
have made some considerable noise."</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Rainsfield," replied the bland <i>employé</i>,
"I assure you, sir, there could have
been no noise; otherwise, sir, with my keen
hearing, I would of a certainty have been disturbed;
but their movements, sir, are like
cats, and I defy any one, I say, sir, any one,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
to hear them, even were an individual awake,
and as close to them as I was when sleeping."</p>

<p>Rainsfield smiled, possibly at the conceit of
the little man, but at the same time, probably,
at his knowledge to the contrary; however,
it was not his object, either to quarrel with
Billing, or to enlighten him, so he remarked:</p>

<p>"I think you had better go over to the Fergusons,
Mr. Billing, and see if Tom is there; I
imagine he is; and explain the circumstances
to him, and tell him I would like him to see
what effect the unhappy event has had
at the camp. I think it is better that you
should go in preference to any of the men, as
the circumstances are better known to you.
You can either ride over, or if you prefer it,
which possibly you may, you can take the
ration cart; and I have only to entreat you
to use as much speed as possible. I am
desirous of disabusing the minds of the blacks
(if any, indeed, survive) of any intentional
harm to them being meditated by me; and I
am aware no one could better undertake such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
a mission than my brother."</p>

<p>Mr. Billing readily agreed to visit Fern
Vale, the more so, perhaps, as he imagined by
offering any objection he might be required to
perform a less agreeable journey. So as he
was not to undergo another edition of the
punishment of the Alma trip, he readily
agreed, and was, therefore, speedily on his way
to Fern Vale, to look for Tom Rainsfield.</p>

<p>After Billing's departure, Mr. Rainsfield
again visited the store, to witness in daylight
the success of his trap; and he contemplated
the gap in the wall, and the absence of the
flour and meat with a degree of complacency
and satisfaction that would almost have impressed
a beholder with a belief that he was
inwardly comforting himself with the meditation
of a recently performed charitable action.</p>

<p>"Well, I begin to think," said he to himself,
"that my plans have been executed pretty
cleverly. Everybody will believe that the
blackguards have been poisoned by mistake;
and their own mistake too. So that no blame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
can be attached to me; and I shall have
the immense advantage of having effectually
stopped their depredations. I wonder what my
friend John Ferguson will do for his <i>protegés</i>?
will he pine for them? Perhaps he may recriminate
me for my treatment of him, and
try to accuse me of their murder; but he can't,
and he dare not. The law will protect me;
and if he dares to breathe one word against
my name he shall rue the day he uttered it.
I hate that young viper as intensely as formerly
I liked him. He has thwarted me in
more ways than one; he dares to oppose
Smithers in his suit with Eleanor, and to
show his contempt for me by carrying on his
intrigue under my very eyes, and in my own
house too. But he shall not have her; so long
as there is breath in my body I will not permit
it, in fact I cannot; she must be Smithers',
and, by heaven! she shall. He has dared to
show fight after I cautioned him; the villain!
and then to inflame those infernal blacks
against me; the vile dog! he shall smart for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
it. His lively blacks have already got their
deserts; and, I have no doubt, by this time
are rotting on their own ground."</p>

<p>"Thou shalt not kill," suggested conscience.</p>

<p>"Oh, bah!" exclaimed the culprit, "what a
fool I am, to be continually chiding myself for
the fate of these wretches. They die by their
own act, so let their death be answered for by
themselves;" saying, or rather thinking which,
the conscience-stricken man turned on his heel
and left the store.</p>

<p>In the meantime let us retrospect for a few
hours, and trace the movements and proceedings
at the camp. When Jemmy Davis left
Tom Rainsfield at the crossing-place, he returned
to the camp, where the discussion,
interrupted by Tom's arrival, was renewed
with increased force. The excitement of the
disputants ran so high that any one unacquainted
with the verbose inanition of such
argumentary proceedings, and the natural
antipathy of the blacks to bellicosity, would
have imagined that the termination of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
meeting would have been of a tragical
character. However, it ended, as all such
meetings usually do with them, viz., in
words; and, towards midnight, the animated
disputants sank under the fatigue of their
disquisition, and in a short time all was
hushed.</p>

<p>As the embers of the fires gave a fitful
glare on the now silenced camp a head might
have been seen protruding from the aperture
of one of the gunyahs; and, after surveying
the scene for some time, and putting its ear
to the ground to catch, if possible, any sound
that would denote watchfulness on the part
of the tribe, it, or rather the body to which
it belonged, crept from the habitation in that
posture designated in nursery parlance "all
fours." With spear in hand it passed round
to the back; where the individual assumed a
more upright position, though he still crept
under the shade of the gunyahs. Then lightly
striking in succession the bark structures with
his spear as he went along he was joined by
about twenty men; whose appearance was so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
sudden that they almost appeared to have
been called into instantaneous existence by
the potent wand of the conjurer.</p>

<p>This was Dugingi and a select band of
confederates, his supporters in the late discussion;
and they moved away from the camp,
to carry out their predetermined plot of robbing
the store of the Strawberry Hill station.
The opposition to the scheme had been strenuous;
and the disapproving blacks, headed
by Jemmy Davies, being the most numerous
and loud in their condemnation of the project,
had retired, fully convinced that the idea had
been abandoned by Dugingi and his party.
But they had been deceived, for Dugingi was
only quieted, not dissuaded; and the present
secret expedition was the result of the defeat
on his motion for a general movement. He
was determined, in his own mind, to rob the
premises of Mr. Rainsfield; and, if he could
not obtain the concurrence of his tribe, he
was resolved to perform it simply with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
assistance of some of his own party.</p>

<p>We have already seen how he affected an
entrance to the store; so we need not trouble
our readers by tracing his movements while
perpetrating the theft. Suffice it to say, that
at an early hour in the morning, the party
returned to the camp with all the rations they
could lay their hands upon in the store; and
which, we have already noticed, consisted of
the carcass of a sheep and a bag of flour.</p>

<p>Their first proceeding, then, was to heap
up their fires; on which they threw their
meat to roast, and then set the gins to work
with the flour to make "damper." These
preparations soon aroused the entire camp,
who were in a moment alive and stirring. At
the first glance Jemmy Davies detected the
state of affairs; and saw that he had been
outwitted by Dugingi; who, while he (Jemmy)
and his party slept, had committed the theft,
and were now preparing to feast on the spoil.
He was grieved at the sight; because he had
given his word to Tom Rainsfield that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
would prevent any outrage if possible, and he
had a sincere desire to pacify his countrymen
in their animosity towards Mr. Rainsfield.
He therefore cautioned his partizans against
tasting the food; and, in the language of his
tribe, addressed them in the following words:</p>

<p>"My brothers&mdash;our brother Dugingi has
behaved bad to us; and bad to the white
fellow. Bad to us, because he went away to
the white fellows' 'humpey,' when we wanted
him not to go, and when, if we had known him
going, we would have prevented him; and
bad to the white fellows because he steals his
'rations.' The white fellow is very strong, and
very brave; and has plenty of horses and
guns; and he will take revenge on the black
fellow. Dugingi steals the white fellow's rations,
and the white fellow thinks all the Nungar
tribe steals it, and he will hate all the Nungar
tribe. I have been to the great country where
the white fellows 'sit down.' Our fathers
thought once that when the black fellow
dies he afterwards 'jump up white fellow;'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
but white fellows come a 'long way more
farther' than big waters, and have gunyahs
higher than the tall bunya tree; and with
very many humpies in them. Some of them
would hold all the Nungar tribe. Now, my
brothers, do you think we can fight against
the white fellows? The white fellows will
fight us, if we steal their rations; and we cannot
fight them, for they must kill us if we do.
Now, the white fellow <i>will</i> fight us, for Dugingi
has stolen his rations; he has brought
upon us this trouble; for he did it when we
wished him not to; and the white fellow will
think all the Nungar black fellows did it.</p>

<p>"Now this is what I say. I have been
telling the white fellow Tom Rainsfield, that
we would not steal from his brother; and I've
been telling him that we want to live, and
we want to be friends with him and his
brother, as we are friends with the white fellow
Ferguson and his brother. And the white
fellow Tom Rainsfield says he is friends with
us. Now what do you think he will say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
when he finds the black fellow has been stealing
his rations? He will say all black fellows
are rogues, and all black fellows liars; and
he will no longer be our friend. But, my
brothers, you take not the food from Dugingi
that he has stolen from the white fellow.
Touch it not; but let him and his friends eat
it if they will, and let them give it to their
gins if they will; and may it choke them,
and may they die. But I will go to the white
fellows, and will tell them myself, that
Dugingi and his friends did steal the rations,
and not the Nungar tribe; so we, my brothers,
will be friends with the white fellows."</p>

<p>At the conclusion of this address Jemmy
Davies left the thieves in possession of their
prize, and was followed by the majority of
his supporters; notwithstanding that the
savoury smell of the roasting meat was particularly
grateful to their olfactory nerves,
and they were sadly tempted to remain and
partake.</p>

<p>Dugingi little heeded the harangue of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
opponent, which was greeted with a shout of
derision from the whole of the foraging party;
who continued with their culinary operations
in the highest possible state of hilarious
loquacity; rending the air with their shouts,
and making the bush reverberate with their
laughter.</p>

<p>The sheep was speedily so far cooked as to
serve their purposes, and tearing it to pieces
amongst them they were soon busily engaged
in the process of mastication. The "damper"
was devoured with equal avidity; and when
they had all eaten to satiety, as the sun rose
resplendent to walk his diurnal course, they
stretched themselves to sleep with the complacency
of satisfied gormands.</p>

<p>No such comfort, however, was allowed
them. First one, and then another, became
restless; a gnawing pain devoured their
stomachs; an insatiable thirst consumed
them; and then the first painful wail was
heard that proclaimed the poison at its work.
The wail increased; the agonies of the victims<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
became insufferable; and, in their anguish
and suffering, many rushed to the river to
drink their last draught; while others threw
themselves into the fires or on the ground,
gnashing their teeth and biting the earth in
the intensity of their torments. All now
bemoaned their fate, and cursed their participation
in what they plainly saw was their
funeral feast.</p>

<p>Jemmy Davies calmly, though sorrowfully,
gazed upon the scene. He imagined the cause
of his countrymen's sufferings, for he had, in
the days of his civilisation, seen his master
poison meat for the native dogs, and he had
seen them die from the effects of the poison.
He therefore understood its mysterious workings,
and at once detected its operations in
the suffering beings before him. Not so his
countrymen; they imagined their fate was
produced by his curse; believing that he
possessed the secret power of working their
death by some spells or occult influence he
had acquired from the whites; and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
therefore crouched before him and implored
his relief. But he, poor semi-savage, could do
nothing for them, and he knew they must die.
The melancholy scene before him overcame
his fortitude, and he burst into tears as he
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"I can't help you, my brothers; I do not
kill you, it is the white fellow that kills you
for stealing his rations. He has made his
meat to kill you because you eat it; if you
had not eaten it you would have lived."</p>

<p>As the residents of Fern Vale early bestirred
themselves on this eventful morning their
astonishment was great at the continued altercations
which seemed to agitate the black's
camp. None of the party had ever heard
them continue their discussions so unceasingly;
and the Fergusons and their friends were disposed
to think that it presaged some evil.
They therefore proposed, that their intended
visit for that day should be made at once, so
that they might learn the cause of the strange
agitation; and acting on this decision the four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
horsemen were speedily mounted and on their
way to the "flats."</p>

<p>They had reached the bank of the river,
and were about entering the water to cross,
when they were stopped by hearing a voice
in their rear calling upon Tom Rainsfield.
He instantly turned towards the new comer,
whose appearance greatly surprised him, and
anxiously demanded of him the nature of his
message. This was given in as few words as
Mr. Billing's habitual sinuosity of expression
could devise utterance; and hastily desiring
the storekeeper to remain where he was with
the cart until his (Tom's) return from the
camp, he joined his friends and rode through
the ford.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with you, Tom?" said
William as they passed through the water,
"you seem quite nervous and agitated? Has
Billing brought you any news that has annoyed
you?"</p>

<p>"He has indeed, my dear fellow," replied
Tom, "brought me news that overwhelms me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
How my brother will be able to reconcile the
act to his conscience I do not know; when I,
who, as God knows, had no participation in it,
feel the weight of murder on my soul."</p>

<p>"Murder!" exclaimed his friends. "What
on earth do you mean Tom? you're surely
raving! How murder? explain yourself,"
said John.</p>

<p>"I wish to God I was raving," replied he;
"that my fears were only a fantasy of the
mind; or that that prating idiot Billing had
merely dreamed the story he has just now
told me. But it seems too substantial; all
the circumstances that have transpired, and
those that are at this very time transpiring,
lead to prove it. There! hear you that wail?
that is the death-cry of scores of those
wretched blacks. Hark! there it is again;
does not that cry rise up to heaven? and
will not our family there be judged for
this? If I could but think it were accidental
I would be satisfied; though I fear,
I fear, oh, horrid thought! murdered by my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
brother."</p>

<p>"Calm yourself, my dear sir," said the
minister, who had with deep sorrow been
witnessing the outpourings of his companion's
grief. "Though you have not mentioned
to us the nature of the communication
received through the messenger from your
home, we would infer from your remarks
that some dreadful calamity has come upon
this tribe through the agency of your brother;
whom, God forbid that you should condemn,
without being thoroughly convinced of his
guilt. It affords us consolation to hear you
express only a fear that your brother has not
acted up to the precepts of his Maker, and the
dictates of his conscience. I sincerely trust,
as I believe, that your fears are groundless,
and that you over-estimate the criminality, if
any criminality exist. I pray you dispel any
such belief from your mind, until at least
you have indubitable proof of your brother's
crime; and, in the meantime, be charitably
disposed towards him, for you may be doing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
him an injustice by your harsh suspicions. It
is true we are unacquainted with the circumstances
which arouse them, but we sincerely
trust you will find you have been deceived."</p>

<p>"I would readily, oh! I long to believe,"
exclaimed Tom Rainsfield, "that it was unintentional;
but my heart tells me there has
been duplicity. I feel a portion of the mental
load, consequent on crime, attached to me;
for only the night before I pledged my word
to those who may be now in the convulsive
agonies of death that I would befriend them
and bring about a reconciliation with my
brother. I know his nature well; he is hasty
and impetuous; and, though kind-hearted
and generous, he is severe and even cruel
where his passions are aroused; so I fear the
worst. But I will tell you the cause of these
people's wails. It appears that my brother,
after I had left the station yesterday, poisoned
a sheep for the purpose, he said, of destroying
the native dogs on the station. That sheep
was left in the store during the night, when it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
was stolen by the blacks, who have, no doubt
ere this, feasted on it, and are meeting their
fate in a violent death. Now, the circumstances
which I am surprised at, and deprecate,
are these:&mdash;Leaving the poisoned meat in a
place above all others where, if the blacks intended
to visit us, they would go first; sending
Billing clandestinely into Alma for the
poison; and having all the stores removed
into the house during his absence, leaving
nothing in it but the poisoned meat, and a bag
of flour, in the full expectation, I am afraid,
that the blacks were going to rob us. But
the most extraordinary part of my brother's
conduct is, that he kept me in entire ignorance
of Billing's journey, which in itself was unusual,
for he never before left the station on
any pretence; and the next incongruity was
this crusade against the dingos, which have
given us no annoyance for some time past.
Many smaller events now flash across my
mind, which tend to stimulate my fears; however,
as you kindly remark, I ought not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
judge too harshly of my brother; and I will
try, until I see more definite cause for my
alarms, to believe him innocent of any intentional
murder. But listen to those poor
wretches; are not their cries piteous?"</p>

<p>Truly they were; and as the shrieks and
howls of the victims pierced the ears of the
quartette, as they crossed the river and entered
the scrub, all their feelings of compassion
were aroused; and they accelerated their
speed, hoping to be of assistance, where no
human efforts could avail.</p>

<p>The picture that presented itself to their
astonished vision, as they emerged from the
mazy labyrinths of the scrub into the area of
the camp, was fearfully sickening and revolting.
Scattered on the ground, in indescribable
postures and contortions, were writhing bodies
of men women and children, giving vent to
cries that would have melted a heart of stone;
anon starting from their recumbent position,
to stand erect in the freshness of the morning
breeze, only to enjoy a momentary respite;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
and then flinging their arms wildly in the air
with an agonizing shout, to fall again prostrate
to the earth, and yield, with a convulsive
shudder, their spirits to their Maker.</p>

<p>Our party had gazed upon this scene for
some minutes ere the miserable objects before
them noticed their presence; the extent
of their sufferings absorbing all their
faculties, and our friends remained unnoticed
or unheeded spectators of the dire destruction
working around them. However, they were at
last perceived; and, before they could devise
the meaning, many of the suffering objects
crawled to their feet, and with imploring
looks and gestures, sought relief from that
death which they imagined was the result of
some mysterious agency caused by the will
of the white man. The malady had reached
its exacerbation; and the miserable sufferers, as
they prostrated themselves at the feet of their
white-skinned brethren, sank in groups to rise
no more. The picture was more than affecting
(even if such existed) to natures possessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
of no spark of human feeling; while to Tom
its contemplation was fearful, and he turned
from the spot to conceal his emotion.</p>

<p>Mr. Wigton, recovering from a momentary
abstraction into which he had been cast by
sorrows of the event, addressed to the sufferers
in their own language words of commiseration
and comfort. He did not, however, disguise
from them their condition; but told them
they would not live, for that they had eaten
of that which destroyed life, even the white
man's life; and that no white man could
help them.</p>

<p>"Then why did the white man kill us?"
they piteously asked.</p>

<p>"My brothers," replied the messenger of
peace, "the white man made the food for
the dingos which kill his sheep, and your
brothers did steal the food, and did eat it,
and will die; but the white man is sorry
that you eat it, and is sorry that you die.
We would all save you if we could, but we
can't; and, my poor brothers, we can only ask<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
the great Spirit in the skies to look down
upon you and save you if He will. He is a
good and great Spirit and could save you, if
you would be His children and His brothers;
He loves even the black fellow, if the black
fellow will love Him; and He knows all about
the black fellow, what the black fellow likes,
and does, and thinks. He lived a long time
ago down on the ground with us, and told us
all these things, and He now lives in the skies,
and sees all that the black fellows do. He
saw the black fellows last night steal the food,
and He was very angry with them; but He
would forgive, even as the white man forgives
them, if they would be sorry for doing bad
things, and would do them no more, but love
the great Spirit. But the great Spirit says
some of you have been very bad, and that you
will not love Him; and so you must die.
But if you will love him, He will save some
of you, even some of you that have eaten the
white man's food."</p>

<p>The wail that followed this <i>petite</i> sermon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
of Mr. Wigton was the death knell of many;
while the preacher himself was so overcome
by the horrors of the scene that he had not perceived
the approach of a ferocious black, who,
leaping over the bodies of the dead and dying,
advanced to within a few feet of him. This
being confronted him in a menacing attitude
almost face to face, and held a spear poised
in his uplifted hand ready to bury it in the
heart of the clergyman whenever he should
so determine.</p>

<p>He was a tall athletic black, of good make,
and, for an aboriginal, considerable muscular
development; he had a determined and ferocious
aspect; his eyes were blood-shot and
swollen; his nostrils were dilated, while they
exuded a fetid secretion horribly offensive.
He foamed at his mouth, and the sinews and
muscles of his face contracting spasmodically
under the influence of the agonies
caused by the poison he had taken, he presented
a most hideous spectacle. Instantly
upon confronting the clergyman, he accosted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
him thus:</p>

<p>"You not know me, white man? I am
Barwang; brother belonging to Dugingi, and
he is dead. The white fellow kill him, and
kill plenty of black fellow: but I live. I not
die, though very sick. I live to kill all white
fellows. You like to see black fellow die:
you think black fellow cannot kill white
fellow, you shall see." He stretched his arm
with the poised weapon to pierce the heart of
Mr. Wigton; but just at that moment, when
the spear was leaving the fingers of Barwang,
it was suddenly snatched from his grasp by a
black, who sprang from some covert, and,
passing behind his countryman with a bound,
deprived him of the offensive weapon; and
stood in his turn with it balanced towards the
frustrated homicide. At the same moment
Tom Rainsfield, who had witnessed the danger
of Mr. Wigton, leapt forward to protect him
with his person, though the opportune act of
the friendly black rendered such unnecessary;
while Barwang, thus seeing himself assailed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
on both sides, made good his retreat.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Jemmy Davies," said Tom,
"that was nobly done, and an act I will not
forget. I have been looking out for you ever
since I have been in the camp, but have never
seen you until this moment. At last I began
to fear that you had fallen a victim to
this dreadful malady, but am pleased to see
that you at least have escaped. This has
been a fearful business, Jemmy, and it has
given me much sorrow; from what I told
you last night, and from what you told me, I
thought we would have been able to have
established a friendship between your tribe
and ourselves, and I felt perfectly satisfied
that our hostilities were at an end. I did not
go home last night, Jemmy (perhaps if I had
I might have prevented the robbery, and
averted the fate of so many of your tribe);
and this morning my brother sent over to
tell me that the black fellows had robbed his
store, and taken away a sheep that he had
poisoned for the native dogs. So you see,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
Jemmy, your tribe came by their death by
persisting in stealing our goods. Many would
say that they merit their fate, but I, Jemmy,
am very very sorry, and would have given
anything I am possessed of to have prevented
it."</p>

<p>"I believe you, Mr. Tom," replied the black.
"I know you are a good friend to the black
fellow, and would not do him any hurt; but
Dugingi and his friends behaved bad to us,
and to you, and have died, and it is well.
They left the camp in the night, after promising
me and my friends that they would not
steal any more from your brother; and we
went to sleep, believing them that they would
not go. But they did go, and stole the meat
and the flour, and the first that I knew of it
was, in the morning, hearing them make a
noise as they were roasting it. I saw at once
what they had done, and spoke to all the
tribe. I told them they would never live in
their country if they stole from the white
fellow, because the white fellow was strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
and would kill them; and that it was better
to be friends with the white fellow and live.
But the friends of Dugingi would not hear
me, and they did eat; but all my friends, that
wished to be friends with the white fellow,
would not eat it, and I told them they were
right, for the food would do them no good.
But Dugingi laughed at me, and roasted the
meat and made damper with the flour; and
he and his brothers and friends eat the meat,
and they gave the damper to their gins and
piccaninies. They all died, except Barwang
and two or three more, who quarrelled over
their shares, and had it eaten by the others.
So they have not died because they did not
get enough to kill them. If they had seen
you alone they would have tried to kill you;
and it was because I saw Barwang coming to
you that I watched him and took his spear.
He won't stop with us now, he will be too
frightened, and will go with his friends to the
tribe in the mountains."</p>

<p>"Did you say," asked Tom, "that the gins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
and piccaninies only eat the damper? did
they not get any of the meat? Surely they
did not die by only eating the damper?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Tom," replied the black, "only
damper, and they died too. The damper and
meat were both poison together; the black
fellows eat the meat and they died, and the
gins and piccaninies eat the damper and they
died."</p>

<p>A cloud came over the brow of Tom Rainsfield
as he heard this. "As I dreaded!" he
muttered to himself. "I would almost have
given my life, Jemmy, to have prevented this;
but it is done, and it cannot be remedied.
The only satisfaction I feel is that you were
wise, Jemmy, and would not let yourself or
your friends taste the poison, thus saving
yourself and them. I will stop with you now
a little while, and see what I can do for you;
but wait;" and turning to his friends he said
to them: "I will remain here with Jemmy
Davies for some hours, but I need not detain
you. Leave me here, and return home; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
if you will merely mention to Billing what
you have seen, that will be sufficient for him
to communicate to his master."</p>

<p>"William was going over to your place this
morning," replied John, "and he may as well
depart at once; but for ourselves, I will
remain with you, and I have no doubt it is
the intention of Mr. Wigton to do the same."</p>

<p>The latter gentleman having expressed his
determination to wait at the camp William
was dispatched to join Mr. Billing, to whom
he was to communicate the tidings of death,
and then proceed to Strawberry Hill to take
home his sister.</p>

<p>The three whites, accompanied by their
black friend, now walked through the camp;
and for the first time saw the extent of the
devastation. It was now stilled. Bodies lay
scattered in every direction, while no strife or
contention now agitated their minds. It appeared
as if the destroying angel had spread
his arm over the devoted tribe, and hushed
their voices for ever; for death had done his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
work with an effectual hand; and though
only a portion had suffered, the rest, from a
fear to face the grim tyrant in the majesty of
his presence, lay concealed within the precincts
of their own habitations.</p>

<p>When we stand by the couch that supports
the frame of some dear friend or relative,
while the spirit wafts itself from its earthly
shrine to that ethereal haven of its rest where
it "beacon's from the abode where the eternal
are;" and when the slightest utterance of
grief is suppressed in the solemn silence that
we maintain to catch the last breath of the
departing loved one: and when that soul is
fled, and we gaze on the placid features, and
fear ourselves to breathe lest we should
disturb the sleep of the quiescent and unconscious
clay, and recall its spirit to a renewal
of its earthly trials: when we visit
the scene of some mighty conflict (sombred
and silenced by the shades of night), where
the powers militant have exhausted their
strength, and left their best blood and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
blossom of their countries to bleach upon the
battle plain: when we walk through the
desolate streets of an infected city, where
pestilence has cut off the first-born in every
family, and where no sound is heard save the
faint cries of the dying, or the distant
rumbling of mortals' last mundane vehicle:
wherever, in fact, and whenever we gaze
upon scenes where the grave reigns paramount,
then we feel the true force of the
expression "the stillness of death prevailed."
And as Tom Rainsfield and his party threaded
the corpses of young and old, men, women,
and children, they felt the awfulness of the
scene, and were too much absorbed with their
own thoughts, to break a silence that was a
mutual comfort and respite.</p>

<p>"Here is some of the damper, sir," said
Jemmy Davies, as he pointed to the lifeless
form of a gin, with a large piece in her hand,
clutched as in the agony of death. "You
see, sir, she has been eating that, and it has
killed her; for the black fellows themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
eat all the meat."</p>

<p>What the feelings of Tom were, when he
stooped to release the pernicious food from
the grasp of the woman, we cannot describe;
but sorrow was depicted in his countenance,
and his strong manly features were disturbed
by the force of his mental sufferings. He
silently broke off a small piece from the lump;
and, kindling a flame from the embers of one
of the fast dying fires, burnt it to endeavour
to detect the presence of arsenic by its exhalation
of a garlic odour. Not satisfying
himself by this test, he put the remains into
his pocket while he said to the black, "I will
take this with me, Jemmy, and see if it contains
any poison; but I trust to God you are
mistaken, and that these poor deluded wretches
have at least in this eaten wholesome food.
"Oh, harrowing thought!" he exclaimed, "to
think that my brother should have been the
witting instrument of this people's destruction."</p>

<p>"By this," said Mr. Wigton, "it would certainly
appear strange; but we must not deprecate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
your brother's conduct on mere suspicion.
You know the Scriptures tell us that we are to
'judge not lest we also be judged;' and also
that vengeance rests with the Almighty. If
your brother has committed this great wickedness
and sinned against his God, let his Maker
be his judge, and his own conscience his
scourge; for 'cursed are they who worketh
iniquity,' and 'the judgment of the Lord
overtaketh the evil-doers,' even in this life;
while in the next, 'the wages of sin is death.'
He may escape the punishment of a human
judicature, but he can never wholly satisfy
the still small voice of conscience, nor at all
escape the high tribunal of his Maker. When
the last trump of the archangel shall summon
him before the 'great white throne,' to give
an account of the deeds done in the body,
then shall the true nature of this action be
known, whether it was the result of a mere
inadvertency, or the premeditated plan of
murder. In the meantime, with all sincerity, I
pray God that it may be the former; and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
the soul of your brother may not be inscribed
with the guilt of so diabolical a crime as the
destruction of so many of his fellow-creatures.
It is but right that all justice should be given
him; and therefore, in the first place, I think
you are correct in determining whether or not
the flour contains poison, as surmised by
Jemmy Davies. If it does, submit the fact to
your brother for explanation, and afford him an
opportunity (if it be possible) of exculpating
himself."</p>

<p>"I agree with you perfectly, Mr. Wigton,"
replied Tom; "let the Almighty and my
brother's conscience be his judges, if he has
committed this crime. But I feel for these
poor blacks, the more that I have endeavoured
to bring about a reconciliation, and only last
night pledged myself to befriend them."</p>

<p>"I know and all my friends know, Mister
Tom," exclaimed Jemmy Davies, "that you
would not do us any harm, and we all like
you; yet most of our tribe hate your brother
for this, though Dugingi did steal the meat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
and they did not want him to. I am not
angry with your brother, but my friends are;
and I am afraid they never will like him.
You will not be troubled any more with us,
for my friends will never steal from your
brother; but they will always be frightened
to take anything from him as friends."</p>

<p>"I am exceedingly sorry to hear you say
that," said Tom, "as I had hoped, even out of
this catastrophe, some good might have resulted.
I had thought that since the removal
of our implacable opponent we could have
lived on terms of amity with your tribe; and
I yet hope to accomplish that aim. However,
in the meantime, let us see what can be done
with the bodies."</p>

<p>"If you will permit me to make a suggestion,"
said John Ferguson, "you will let me
go home, and get one or two of our men with
spades, that we may dig one grave for the
whole of the bodies."</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Ferguson," replied Jemmy Davies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
"My tribe would not like them buried that
way; they would rather do it their own way,
thank you. We will bury them here in the
camp, and then leave it for ever. We will
bury them all to-day, and then good-bye.
You had better not stop Mr. Ferguson and
Mr. Tom; leave us now, and we'll say good-bye."</p>

<p>"My friend! permit us to stay," said Mr.
Wigton; "we wish to befriend you if it be
in our power. Let us help you to bury your
dead, and when you have finished let me say
a few words to your tribe."</p>

<p>"You can all stay if you like," said Jemmy;
"but we are many and we don't want you to
help us, it is not work for white fellows. I
will tell my tribe you want to stay, and they
won't heed you; and I will tell them you
want to speak to them, and they will hear you."
With this Jemmy Davies shouted some words
in his own vernacular, at which the survivors
of the tribe emerged from their concealment;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
and he continued to his visitors: "They say
that if the white fellows wish they can stop,
and if the budgery (good) white fellow who
woollers (talk) belonging to great Spirit, wishes
to talk to them, they will listen."</p>

</div>

<p>The blacks commenced their obsequies
with a lugubrious mien; and after collecting
the bodies, which numbered nearly a hundred,
prepared to entomb them according to their
own peculiar custom. Usually, upon the death
of a black, the surviving relatives bemoan
their loss by besmearing themselves with
coloured clay or mud, and venting their grief
for days in fasting, frantic gestures, and wails;
while the gin (if the deceased be a man possessed
of one) covers her head with white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
feathers, which species of mourning she wears
for a "moon," <i>i.e.</i>, a month. On this occasion,
however, the deceased were nearly all the members
of separate families, and the survivors had
little sympathy for them, except in common;
consequently, the last rites were performed in
uniform silence.</p>

<p>For each body was erected four forked posts
(standing about four feet high), on which were
formed a platform of boughs, so as to make a
sort of foliate table to support the lifeless clay.
The bodies, when duly placed, were then over-spread
with long dry grass, and, afterwards,
with an outer covering of boughs, which, to
be prevented being removed by the weather,
were tied together at each end as a bundle of
sticks. These impromptu sepulchres were
elevated from the ground just sufficiently to
prevent the access of the native dogs, and protected
overhead from the molestation of carnivorous
birds by the covering we have
described. They are, however, no more defended,
than a subterranean tenement would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
be, from the depredations of insects and vermin;
the most numerous of which, who attack
this, or any other carrion in the Australian
bush, being ants; which have rightly been
designated "nature's scavengers."</p>

<p>In such encasements it is not to be wondered
at that the flesh is speedily removed
from the bones; and, after a short time, they
stand inoffensive monuments to the memory
of departed friends. They remain intact for
years; until, either consumed by some bush
fire, washed away by some gigantic flood, or
the supports give way under the decay of
successive seasons, the sepulchre and its enshrined
contents fall together to the earth to
reunite with their parent dust.</p>

<p>When the blacks finished their toil, the
cemetery had a most extraordinary appearance.
With nearly a hundred four-legged tombs, of
various size placed side by side, and their
heads set facing the rising sun, they almost
filled the centre space of the camp; and, with
the conical gunyahs around them in a wide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
circle, they presented, at the cessation of the
buryer's work, one of the most novel and picturesque
scenes that could be imagined.</p>

<p>Upon being informed by Jemmy Davies
that he could now speak to the blacks Mr.
Wigton called them together, and addressing
them in their own language, said: "My
friends! you say I am the white man who
speaks of the great Spirit; I would speak of
him to you now. I know that you say there
is no good Spirit, only an evil one; but you
are wrong, for there are both; and of the
good one I will now tell you. A very long
time ago he made all the big hills, and large
rivers, the plains, and the great sea; and he
made man, and all the beasts, birds, and
fishes; he made white men, and black men;
he made everything. When he made the
first man, he told him he would love him, and
teach him great wisdom, if he would do what
the great Spirit wished. He gave him a wife
and put them both in a large country, where
was plenty fruit that possums and parrots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
like, and which was very good for man. But
one tree was there that they were not to
touch; because it belonged to the evil spirit.
The good Spirit told man, that if he eat the
fruit that grew on that tree he would be
wicked, and the good Spirit wouldn't love
him. But when the good Spirit left him, and
the man and his wife 'walked all about,' and
saw a very fine country with plenty of fruit
to eat, and plenty of animals who would not
do him any harm, but come to him when he
called them, he was very much pleased. But
the evil spirit presently came to the woman
and said to her, 'Now, you take that fruit that
the good Spirit says belongs to me, and that
is not good; you will find it very good, the
best in the country; it belongs to me and
you may take as much of it as you like.'
Now the woman did not care what the good
Spirit had told her, so she took it, and gave
some of it to the man, after telling him what
the evil spirit had said to her, and they both
eat it. But when the good Spirit knew it, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
was very angry; and told the man and the
woman, that as they had done what he had
told them not to do, and had stolen the fruit
off the tree which he told them not to touch,
he would turn them out of the country into
another country where there was no fruit
growing, and where the beasts were all wild
and where they would have to work for their
food, and always be in danger and trouble.
So you see the first trouble that there was in
the world, was from stealing and disobeying
the good Spirit; and the man and woman
were punished, though they did not die like
your friends this morning.</p>

<p>"Well, my friends, the man and woman
lived a long time together, and they died;
and others grew up, and they died; and so
on, until by and bye a great many people
lived on the earth, who forgot all about the
good Spirit; just as you have done. Then
the good Spirit was very sorry for them,
because they did as the evil spirit told them;
and when they died, they all went to the evil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
spirit, and lived with him in fire. But the
good Spirit wished them to live with Him in
a beautiful country, where they would never
want to eat and drink, but would always be
happy. So He sent them His Son to tell them
what to do to please Him, and make themselves
happy, when they 'jump up' again in
the sky, after they die on the earth. He told
them what to do, but very few of the people
did it; for the evil spirit always persuaded
them not to notice Him, or believe Him.
But the good Spirit did many good things for
them. He brought to life again some of their
friends after they had died; and He made
food 'jump up' when they were hungry, their
clothes never to wear out, and plenty such
things. And He told them that if they did
as he said they would go to His Father's
country in the sky, and live there with Him
in happiness and never die; but that if they
would not do as He told them, they would
have to go to the evil spirit, where they would
be always burning, and never die either; while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
their sufferings would always continue. To
escape this, and procure happiness, He told
them what they must do. The good Spirit
loved them; so they must love the good Spirit.
The good Spirit hated murder, theft, lies,
and cruelty; so they must hate them too.
They must be peaceable and kind to one another,
and, next to the good Spirit Himself,
they must love one another, especially the
poor; and He told them if they would do all
this, the good Spirit would be very pleased,
and would take care of them; but if they
would not do so, then He would be very angry
and punish them. Now, a good many people
believed what the Son of the good Spirit said,
and did as he told them; and when they died
they all went to the good Spirit. But the
evil spirit persuaded a great many more not
to believe Him; and they didn't, but killed
Him; but He 'jumped up' again and went
back to his Father, the good Spirit, and the
people that killed Him, when they died, all
went to the bad spirit to be punished. Now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
the bad spirit is always telling people to do
bad things, to vex the good Spirit, and get the
people himself. They are very foolish, and
do what the evil spirit tells them, and therefore
get sent to his place of fire, and are very
wretched. And I must tell you, my friends,
both the Good and evil spirit still live, and
are always walking about. They are both
here just now, and were here last night; the
good Spirit told you not to steal the white
man's food, and you were good and did not
steal it; but the evil spirit told Dugingi and
his friends to go and steal it, and they did,
and died.</p>

<p>"Now, my friends, which of these would
you like for your master? The good Spirit?
then do as he tells you. Love him and give
up killing one another, and stealing, and
telling lies, and hating the white man. I will
stop with you, and teach you how to love the
good Spirit; so that when you die you will
go to the good Spirit in the sky. But if you
will not love the good Spirit, and will not do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
as He tells you, then you will be the friends
of the evil spirit, and be burnt up with him
in his fire. The evil spirit is a very bad
spirit, and will tell you all sorts of things to
make you not to love the good Spirit. He
will tell you it is of no use; that the good
Spirit does not care for you, and will not
trouble about you, and that he only cares for
the white man; but do not believe him, for
he wants to get you for himself. You try to
live as the good Spirit tells you, and you will
not only enjoy the happiness with the good
Spirit when you die, but you will be happy
while you live here; and now, my friends, I
will pray to the good Spirit for you."</p>

<p>Mr. Wigton then lifted his voice in earnest
supplication to his Master, to beseech in His
unbounded beneficence, that He would dispel
the darkness from the minds of the poor
benighted heathen before Him, and reflect on
them the light of His gospel. He concluded
his exhortation and prayer, and found Jemmy
Davies still standing by his side, where he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
had remained during the whole time of the
short discourse, deeply interested with the
truths that flowed from the preacher's mouth.
Not so, however, the rest of the tribe; for Mr.
Wigton had noticed with pain, that after the
first few minutes of his addressing them, they
lost all interest in his gospel story, and showed
evident signs of impatience and uneasiness;
even indulging in frivolities, and taking no
notice of his speaking at all. Though grieved
at this, he yet did not despair of bringing
them to a knowledge of the truth. He had
frequently on former occasions preached to
the blacks with similar success; but his heart
was undaunted; he persevered in his work;
and, in the tribe to whom he was then appealing,
he had hopes (with the blessing and
assistance of God) of planting the seed in
their sterile souls and, by the aid of heaven's
grace, of seeing it germinate and "bring
forth fruit meet for repentance." That such
a hope was visionary, all his friends were in
the habit of telling him; they repudiated the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
idea of the possibility of infusing the truth of
the gospel into the natures of the blacks; but
he had a more exalted faith, and believed the
omnipotence, as well as the mercy of the
Almighty, would still work the regeneration
of this outcast race. He was, therefore,
stimulated to pursue his course in the instruction
of these rude children of nature, to
endeavour to impress upon them an application
of things divine; and he determined to
remain in their neighbourhood as long as
possible, and devote to the work as much of
his time as he could command.</p>

<p>The party now took their leave of Jemmy
Davies and his tribe, and left the scene of
the late distress for the home of the Fergusons;
where they found the news of the massacre
had preceded them, and their two black boys,
Billy and Jemmy, decamped to join the
remnant of the tribe. But in the meantime
we will trace the steps of William Ferguson,
after he left the camp to join Mr. Billing.</p>

<p>William found the storekeeper waiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
very patiently for Tom Rainsfield's return;
and he rather sententiously communicated to
him what he had witnessed, leaving him to
conjecture much of the detail. As he felt
in no humour to be bored by Billing's
loquacity, he excused himself from accompanying
him on the road, on the plea that he
was anxious to get to Strawberry Hill, his
sister being there waiting him; and he left
his companion, and rode on.</p>

<p>When he arrived at the Rainsfields' house
he met Mrs. Billing and the children going
out for a walk; and, upon enquiring for the
ladies, he was told they had been expecting
him for some time, and were at that moment
taking a stroll towards the bridge. After
leaving his horse, thither he followed them;
and found that his sister was ready habited
for her ride, and her friends had stepped out
for a short walk with her before she took her
departure. When they saw William, they all
rallied him on his dilatoriness and want of
punctuality; but he, finding that they knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
nothing of the tragedy amongst the blacks, refrained
from making any explanation; simply
pleading guilty to the indictment of his fair
friends, and begging leniency at their hands.</p>

<p>His sister replied that she had intended, if
he had not made his appearance before their
return from their walk, to have taken off her
habit and stopped at Strawberry Hill, just to
teach him punctuality. But stepping up to
him, and laughingly patting his cheek, she
said that, as he had acknowledged his negligence,
she would not disappoint him, but
start whenever he pleased.</p>

<p>William and his convoy returned to the
house, where they found the table spread
with a light repast ready waiting them; after
partaking which, the girls took an affectionate
leave of one another; and, with repeated
mutual regrets at parting, promises from Kate
to speedily revisit them, and many extorted
pledges and solemn obligations from William,
to frequently bring his sister over, they parted;
and Kate and William left Strawberry Hill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
at a canter, at which pace they continued
until they reached Fern Vale.</p>

<p>Upon their arrival there, the little house-keeper
was received with all honours, and
duly installed in possession of her domicile
and in the importance of her office, with a
gaiety which even Kate's unpractised eye
could detect to be assumed. There was a
gloom upon the whole party, particularly
Tom Rainsfield, that ill accorded with their
usual manner; and it did not fail to strike her.
She saw there was some mystery; and, looking
from one to the other in a state of perplexity,
at last requested an explanation. Tom
excused himself from the task, possibly from
a feeling of delicacy in shocking her young
and innocent mind with a recital of the horrible
events of the past twelve hours; but
her brother John, thinking it better that a
knowledge of the circumstances should be
imparted to her by themselves, in preference
to their reaching her ears through some other
channel, communicated to her as much as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
deemed necessary in the meantime for her to
know.</p>

<p>To say that the story horrified her would
but inadequately describe the sensations with
which she heard the dreadful narrative. She
wept! though not at the usual standard of
young ladies' tears that are shed upon the
most trivial occasions when effect is deemed
by them desirable; such tears are easily
conjured into existence, and have no impression
on the beholder other than as the
sparkling dew on the morning flower excites
the admiration or pleases the fancy of the
florist. Her's were tears of true sympathy,
gushing forth from a warm and affectionate
heart; and the burst of feeling grief of one
who was always joy and sunshine touched
the hearts of her assembled friends; and more
than one strong man, that had calmly looked
on the misery of the poor victims in the very
presence of death, now turned away their
heads to conceal their moistened eyelids.</p>

<p>As soon as Tom Rainsfield could sufficiently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
muster his courage to speak, he took the two
hands of Kate in his, and said in a voice
tremulous with emotion: "My dear Miss
Ferguson, your kind sympathy for these poor
blacks does you infinite honour and credit;
but pray calm yourself. Much as the circumstances
are to be regretted, it is more than
probable they will be found to result to our
benefit, as the greatest ruffians of the whole
tribe have been removed; and we may now
hope to live without fear of any molestation."</p>

<p>The rest of the day passed ordinarily
enough. The Fergusons were fully occupied
in putting their house in order; and Tom
took his leave to see his brother and communicate
to him details that he could not
expect from Mr. Billing. He promised, before
he went, to return the following morning and
join Mr. Wigton in revisiting the camp and
sepulchres of the blacks. True to his engagement,
the next day Tom presented himself at
Fern Vale; when he, Mr. Wigton, and John,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
took their departure on their meditated errand;
leaving William at the station, to superintend
some work which required the presence of
either him or his brother.</p>

<p>As the trio rode on their way, Tom was the
first to break the general silence, by remarking,
"I am sorry to say Jemmy Davies was only
too correct, when he surmised that the flour
had been poisoned as well as the meat. I
have tested it on some animals, with a fatal
result; which leaves it beyond doubt that it
contained poison; while my brother's explanation
of the fact is very equivocal. He may be,
and I trust he is, sincere in his asseverations;
but I must confess that the whole matter
appears to me inexplicable. He denies the
possibility of the flour being poisoned, unless
it were from contact with the meat, or by
their own inadvertent use of the arsenic;
which he says they must have taken from the
store with the other things, under the impression
of its being sugar. Now, though it is
possible that the blacks might have made use
of the fat of the meat in making their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
damper, in the other supposition I don't think
there is a shadow of probability. However,
let it rest between his conscience and his God.
I only trust he will enlighten his wife on the
subject, for I would not like that duty to devolve
upon me, as I could not so far dissemble
as to disguise from her my suspicions;
and I know the knowledge of her husband's
criminality would break her heart."</p>

<p>"You need not doubt, my dear sir," said
Mr. Wigton, "but what she will hear of it from
your brother. He will be sure to tell her, if
it is only to prevent her crediting any other
version that she may hear; so you need have
no apprehension on that head. But let us
consider now, that we are about to revisit
these wretched blacks, what we can do to
ameliorate their condition."</p>

<p>"I share with you, Mr. Wigton, your sympathy
for these poor creatures," said Tom,
"and would gladly render you all assistance
that lies in my power; though that assistance
will necessarily be limited. But I fear their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
regeneration is a task of far greater magnitude
than you conceive; and I am afraid you are
too sanguine."</p>

<p>"Why so? my dear, sir," asked the clergyman;
"nothing is impossible with God! and
with his blessing I have no fear, but that I
shall be able to work great changes in them."</p>

<p>"True," replied Tom, "you may with the
blessing of Providence; but you must excuse
me, my dear sir, if I remind you, that we must
not expect the Almighty to deviate from his
prescribed laws of nature, and work miracles
in the conversion of these savages."</p>

<p>"I don't quite understand you," replied the
minister.</p>

<p>"I will explain," said Tom. "You are
aware that these people's habits and customs,
are totally different from ours, and their
peculiar prejudices are deeply rooted. Now,
I don't deny for a moment the possibility of
the application of the gospel to them, or the
probability of a few of their number accepting
it (though of that I must confess I have little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
hope); but I certainly do think that no great
progress will be made until you can get them
to assimilate their ways to those of civilisation;
and that is the point where you will
find the difficulty."</p>

<p>"For the sake of argument," said Mr.
Wigton, "and to hear your views, I will grant
your theory that civilisation must precede
the preaching of the gospel; as I take it, that
is what you mean. Then I would ask; what
is to prevent their being induced to domesticate
themselves, and live as we?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," replied Tom, "that I see,
except their inherent antipathy to a settled
life, and an existence where they require to
labour to gain a subsistence. Numerous
attempts have been made to wean the blacks
from their wandering, lazy, and unsettled
habits, but without success. You could not
have a better instance than Jemmy Davies;
one perfectly civilized you may say, yet
living a savage life. But for the influence
of his tribe, and his home associations (which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
he could not be induced to renounce), he
might have been made a respectable member
of society; and may yet become one, for he
has had the rough edge of his savage nature
worn off. You may have another instance in
John Ferguson's black boys, who are better
specimens than the general class. You see
they, at the slightest breath of excitement,
leave their work and join the camp. Any
attempts to cultivate their intellects like
Jemmy Davies would be useless, unless like
him they were removed from the influence of
their people. Again, you have another instance
in little Joey; he has been taught to
accommodate himself to the ways of the whites,
and never desires to change his condition.
But that is owing to the fact that he has
known no other, by his having been taken
from his home when quite young, educated
with whites, and never having imbibed the prejudices of his race.</p>

<p>"To christianize the blacks I believe they
must be civilized; and to be civilized they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
must be removed from the influence of their
natural predilections and superstitions; for
if they are not thoroughly and effectually
eliminated from all domestic influence they
will never retain their civilisation, but return
to their tribes upon the earliest opportunity.
On the other hand if they are segregated,
and kept beyond the contamination of their
kindred, they become, from the absence of
their natural habits, alienated from them;
and of necessity they assimilate their ways
to civilisation. I could mention examples
of these, but need only advert to the native
police; who, possibly you are aware, when
they are drafted from their tribes, are instantly
removed to a distance for active
service. The consequence of this is that
they remain in the force because they have
no opportunity of leaving it without coming
into contact with other tribes; the natural
animosities of whom against one another are
such as to render a passage through them to
their own tribe extremely perilous. There is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
no propinquity or friendly intercourse between
them; and the native police are therefore
retained in service, if not from choice, at
least from a knowledge of security.</p>

<p>"Do not imagine, Mr. Wigton, that I
argue the impracticability of your scheme
from any spirit of opposition; nothing is
further from my intention. I am far rather
desirous to accomplish their disenthralment,
though I fear it cannot be effected without
alienating them first from their own peculiar
habits."</p>

<p>"I will not attempt to argue with you on
the subject," replied Mr. Wigton, "because I
cannot but deny the theory that questions the
attributes of the Almighty. I will rather
hope to prove to you the fallacy of your
sophistry by results. You say that Jemmy
Davies is educated; I can see that he is civilized;
and can also perceive, from his attention
to me yesterday, that he is willing to be instructed,
and susceptible of the Christian
impress. And I ask, why cannot the others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
of his tribe be made the same? His training
has been purely of a secular kind; whereas
it would have been as easy, while he was
being taught the rudiments of the English
language, to have had the truths of the gospel
inculcated; and he would now have been in
all probability, if not a Christian, at least a
moral man, and less prone to return to his
former barbarous nature. I would propose,
while instructing the mature, to have a school
for the young, so as to put them under a
regular course of training; and I have no
doubt whatever that the result would be a
speedy regeneration."</p>

<p>"Then, my dear sir," replied Tom Rainsfield,
"to effect it you would have to remove
the children entirely from the influence of
their parents; as otherwise you would never
be able to retain them under you care. The
parents would soon begin to feel the restraint
of your tuition, and would remove to escape
it; while the children, nothing loath to resume
their freedom, would gladly accompany<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
them. To make such a system effective I
believe you would require to detain the
children, even against the wishes of their
parents; and, when their education was
complete, remove them elsewhere to learn
some handicraft so as to accustom them to
labour. Then having been brought up in the
comforts of the whites, and having learnt to
earn a livelihood by the use of their own hands,
they would have lost all yearnings after the
life of their kindred; especially as their
parents, by that time, would have been taught
to look upon them as lost. In a word, to
accomplish their amelioration, you must carry
out a system of domestic expatriation, continuing
to separate the young from the old
until the former will all have been reclaimed,
and the latter in the course of time (as a new
generation grows up) will have totally disappeared."</p>

<p>"I think there is some feasibleness in your
separation scheme," said Mr. Wigton, "but I
think it would be a cruel alternative to dismember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
families in that way; and I do not
despair of effecting the desired object without
such stringent measures, which I question if
the government and society would sanction.
However, here we are at the camp; we will
see the result of our present interview, and
then have an opportunity of further speculation
on this theme."</p>

<p>But as the party rode into the area of the
camp they were surprised to see that it was
empty. Not a black was visible; and to our
friend's repeated "cooeys" not a return sound
was to be heard, not even the distant bark of
the aborigines' dogs. So they concluded that
the camp had been broken up, and Jemmy
Davies and his tribe retired to another part
of the scrub; and as they turned, disappointed
to retrace their steps, Tom said to Mr. Wigton,
"I think you have in this conclusive evidence
of there being no guarantee that without restriction
the blacks will ever receive instruction."</p>

<p>Some time had elapsed since the events
mentioned in the foregoing chapter had transpired;
but few changes had come over the
scene of our narrative. Kate Ferguson had
settled down into the circle of her domestic
duties with a spirit that charmed her brothers
and enchanted every one about her. Mr.
Wigton had, at an early date, left Fern Vale
for Brisbane. The blacks had entirely disappeared
from the country, and Mr. Rainsfield
had almost, if not entirely, forgotten their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
existence and the dreadful means he had
adopted for their expatriation; while Tom
Rainsfield, if he continued to remember it,
never allowed any mention of the circumstances
to pass his lips. The whole of the
events were of course, by "the thousand
tongues of scandal," speedily noised about the
country; but the general feeling exculpated
Rainsfield from any blame, and the judicial
enquiries were extremely superficial. The
government being perfectly satisfied with the
report of the magistrates of the neighbourhood;
who in their turn were content with the
unsubstantiated version of their colleague Mr.
Rainsfield. Tom Rainsfield was a constant
visitor to his friends at Fern Vale; while
William Ferguson and his sister made repeated
visits to "the Hill," though their
brother John rarely moved off his own run.</p>

<p>The spring had set in with its calm salubrious
atmosphere, and plenty and contentment
pervaded all nature. At nearly every
station shearing had been completed; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
except at some of the remote localities where
labour was only with difficulty obtained, the
excitement and bustle incidental to that time
had subsided, and the squatters had settled
down into the monotony of their usual
routine.</p>

<p>At a pretty little spot on a tributary creek of
the Gibson river, about ten miles from Brompton,
was situated the station of Clintown, the
residence and property of a retired medical
man of the name of Graham. This gentleman
was rather a portly individual of stupendous
dimensions; with a body rather obese, and
limbs of great power. His face was decidedly
rubicund, and, kept scrupulously free from
hairy excrescence, displayed a pair of pendent
cheeks. His nose was not much out of
the common, except that it was possessed of
a certain erubescence, which, increasing in
intensity towards the extremity, gave some
indication of the owner's predilection for
spirituous comforts. His cranium on the
summit had a decided tendency to sterility,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
notwithstanding the continual exudation of
an unctuous nourishment; and, but for the
stamp of the voluptuary which was unmistakably
impressed upon his visage, and other
slight defects, would have been considered by
phrenologists a fine head.</p>

<p>If not respected in the district Dr. Graham
was at least tolerated; perhaps more from
dread than any other feeling his presence or
society was likely to create. Among the
lower orders he was generally detested; he
was abhorred by the shepherds whom he employed,
and who never could be induced to
stay with him longer than they were
absolutely compelled; while many were the
charges of rapacity brought against him, by
those who had been in his service, and had
been defrauded of their wages on some unjust
pretext. His bellicosity was well known;
and bold indeed was the man who would
dare to risk an encounter with the self-dubbed
"champion of the Downs." He was reputed
wealthy; or rather his means were supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
to be considerable, though there was a story
attached to their acquisition, which, if true,
reflected lasting opprobrium on this worldly
medicus.</p>

<p>He was said to have been located at one
time as a practitioner in a distant part of the
colony, and to have conceived the idea of
establishing an hospital in a certain town,
centrally situated in the bush. To accomplish
this end he travelled the country soliciting
subscriptions; and such was the confidence
reposed in the individual, whose disinterestedness
and zeal were generally admired, and
the desideratum that such an edifice was
considered, that he was eminently successful
in his canvass. The squatters readily and
munificently subscribed to the project, and
Dr. Graham soon found himself in possession
of a considerable sum of money.</p>

<p>That this money was applied to the purposes
for which it was contributed is more
than doubtful; for the hospital was never
erected, while Dr. Graham shortly afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
became possessed of the station of Clintown.
It was said that some of the subscribers, not
relishing the manner in which they were
taken in, insisted upon a return of their
money, or its legitimate application; and
in some few instances, to quiet the importunities
of those who were disposed to be
turbulent, the money was returned. But in
the majority of the cases the parties were too
timorous or indifferent to make any demands;
and the subscriptions and hospital scheme
remained in <i>statu quo</i>, the one in the pocket, or
rather represented in the sheep of Dr. Graham,
and the other in the fond expectation of the
deluded subscribers. Whether this tale be
true or false we are not in a position to say;
but it was darkly brooded about, no one
daring to venture an open assertion, in consideration
of the pugilistic accomplishment of
the party most concerned. One thing, however,
is certain that the Doctor, prior to the
scheme, was always supposed to be in debt,
from the difficulty "those little accounts"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
could be extorted from him, while after the
successful ruse, he suddenly became possessed,
to a remarkable extent, of a laudable desire
for honourable liquidation.</p>

<p>The general characteristics of Dr. Graham's
nature were as peculiar as his personal appearance.
He was parsimonious and exacting
in his intercourse with his neighbours, and inhospitable
to those not his boon companions;
to whom again, he was lavish and profuse.
Nothing gave him greater pleasure than the
society of a companion who could join him in
copious libations; and upon one occasion he
carried out his principle in a remarkable manner.
He was detained on business for a short
time in Sydney, and was disposed to enjoy
himself in "a little bit of a spree;" though, unfortunately
for his happiness, he could not fall
in with a concomitant spirit to join him in
the way of friendship. None who knew him
were disposed to submit to his imperiousness;
so he was driven to the necessity of procuring,
by engagement, the companionship of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
congenial nature. He, therefore, hired a man
who was recommended to him for the purpose;
an individual who was famous in his generation
for his bibulous capabilities, and willing
to submit to any indignity for a gratuitous
supply of the inebriate's nectar. The debauch
commenced and was conducted with considerable
spirit so long as it lasted; but the principal
and his co-adjutor soon parted, owing, as the
former used to say, to the fellow's incapacity to
take his liquor. His contentment in loneliness
was another feature in his character; which
was also exemplified by another tale often told
about him. He was an enthusiastic lover of
whist, and when he could make up a rubber
with three of his choice spirits he was content;
though still without them he was equally
partial to his hand, and was actually discovered
on one occasion sitting with his usual
solace, his grog and his pipe, silently going
through the formula of playing with three
dummies.</p>

<p>In the sitting-room pertaining to the dwelling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
of this worthy individual, who, we may
mention, had never thought it advisable "to
settle in life," sat three specimens of the genus
homo&mdash;the proprietor of the station, a neighbouring
squatter of the name of Brown, and
our old acquaintance, Bob Smithers. At the
moment of our intrusion upon this triumvirate,
they were assiduously attentive to a dark-coloured
opaque receptacle, containing a brown
stimulating fluid, and which was circulated
(to use an antithesis) in a triangle from one
to the other of this trio, and followed by its
usual concomitant, an earthenware vessel of
a porous nature (containing a more translucent
liquid), and vulgarly denominated "a monkey."
In fact these gentlemen were what steady,
sober, and sedate people would call drinking;
but what they, choice sons of Bacchus, simply
designated "taking a nobbler." They were
also emulating the example of the first potent
initiator, and "blowing a cloud," from three
diminutive and jetty instruments, that were
retained in their dental position, irrespective<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
of any inconvenience to expectoration or
without any hindrance to the conversation,
which was carried on in an animated manner;
the only proceeding that called for a removal
from their ivory fetters being that which was
necessary to alleviate thirst.</p>

<p>At the moment which we have chosen to
introduce this company to our readers a head
was thrust into the room, and a voice called
the master of the establishment, who instantly
left the apartment, after telling his visitors
not to mind his absence. This was an injunction
which was perfectly needless, for, in
the presence of the before mentioned stimulator,
the parties addressed seemed in nowise
disconsolate at his leaving them.</p>

<p>The Doctor's absence was only of short
duration, for in a few minutes he returned
with a bottle in his hand, which he set down
upon the table with the following aphorism:
"May we never want a friend, and a bottle to
give him;" while he continued addressing
Smithers: "Here, Bob, old fellow, here is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
spiritual visitant in the shape of as good
brandy as ever you drank. I have plenty
more, so don't be frightened of the liquor.
I am obliged to keep it in my bed-room, or I
would not have a drop in the house in twelve
hours; those confounded rascals of mine would
rob a church if they could get any drink out
of it;" and then turning to his other friend
he said: "How are you getting on, Brown?
take another 'nip,' and don't shirk your
grog;" at which little pleasantry of his own
he burst into a laugh.</p>

<p>Brown did as he was desired with very
little show of reluctance, and asked of his host
what had occurred to make him so merry.</p>

<p>"Why," said the Doctor, "I have had a
little adventure with one of my fellows, who
wanted to be master; but I soon taught him
submission. My overseer came to tell me
that one of the scoundrels had refused to
work, so I quietly went out to him and
knocked him down. I hate to have words
with the fellows; that's meeting them on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
their own ground. I like to deal with them
pointedly; so when the blackguard got upon
his legs again I told him the next remedy I
would try would be a stock-whip, and if that
failed I would summon him before the bench.
That sent him to work, for my fellows know
it is a bad game to come before the magistrates
with me; so telling him to 'keep his
eye on the picture' I left him, and I'll vow he
won't trouble me again in a hurry."</p>

<p>"But," said Brown, "how have you managed
to establish such a wholesome dread of the
bench in the minds of your men? For my
part, if ever I have any of my fellows up, I
not only rarely obtain any satisfaction, but
am put to a great deal of trouble and inconvenience."</p>

<p>"Oh, I suppose you don't know how to
manage it," replied the Doctor. "I never let
any of my fellows have a case against me. If
they have at any time the impertinence to
serve me with a summons, or lodge a complaint,
I always prevent them getting any of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
their own witnesses, by finding them something
to do to keep them out of the way of a
subp&oelig;na; whereas that overseer of mine is
an uncommonly useful fellow, he always sees
things in the same light that I do."</p>

<p>"But still I can't see," said Brown, "if the
fellows are determined to be troublesome,
how you are to punish them unless they
commit a breach of their agreement; and
they are generally wide awake enough to
keep all right there."</p>

<p>"Nothing easier in the world," replied the
Doctor. "I'll just tell you how I served one
fellow that gave me a great deal of trouble.
He was a 'new chum,' just out from home.
My agent in Brisbane hired him from the
ship when he arrived, and he was an infernally
saucy fellow, as all those new chums
are; for they not only demand higher wages,
but are always more difficult to satisfy, readier
with their objections, and lazier and less
handy with their work, than men with
'colonial experience.' Now, this fellow gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
me some cheek one day, and I thrashed him;
but what do you think of his impertinence?
he actually summoned me for assault. Well,
Bill, my overseer, very conveniently saw him
raise his hand to strike me, so I was forced,
you perceive, to knock him down in self-defence,
and the case was dismissed. But I
was determined to break my fine fellow's
pride, and let him see that he had got into
the wrong box when he fancied he could ride
rough-shod over me; and I wasn't long in
giving him the lesson. I had him engaged
as a shepherd, in the usual way, 'and to make
himself generally useful;' so one fine Sunday
morning, when he had dressed himself in his
'Sunday go-to-meeting clothes,' I found a
nice little job for him that I knew he wouldn't
relish. I had a couple of horses in a paddock
at the other side of the creek; which had
been flooded just previously, so that the
paddock was nearly half covered with mud
and water; and to get over to it there was
no other way than to ford the creek, which I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
give you my word was none of the cleanest
to cross. I ordered the fellow to fetch me
one of the horses, knowing perfectly well that,
as there was not another on the station, he
would have to accomplish it on foot. I was
sure this would try his metal, and guessed he
wouldn't half like the idea of soiling his clean
clothes; and I was right. He didn't like it;
and positively refused to go, saying that he
was not obliged to work on a Sunday beyond
what was absolutely necessary, such as tending
his flock, for which he was engaged. I, however,
put a boy to mind his sheep, and then
ordered him again to bring in the horse for
me; but he still refused. So I just had him
up, under 'the Masters and Servants Act,' for
refusing to obey my lawful orders, and he was
fined forty shillings and ordered to go back
to his work. But he declined to do that, and
was then committed to gaol for a month, at
the expiration of which he was sent back to
his work, whether he liked it or not. Well,
sir, he was always civil after that; but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
determined that he should remember the
lesson. So when his term expired, and I
settled with him for his wages, I charged him
with twenty sheep that had been missing out
of his flock while he had refused to work.
He was fool enough to decline receiving the
balance of his wages, and actually sued me;
but I produced my stock-book before the
bench, when the loss was shown, and my
overseer swore to the deficiency, so my gentleman
had to submit; and, being rather abusive
upon his defeat, I quieted him by threatening
another thrashing, and told him to 'keep his
eye on the picture,' unless he wished to be
still farther treated to a drilling."</p>

<p>"Well," said Brown, "but suppose a fellow
like that should persist in giving you trouble,
his services would not at any wages be worth
having, considering the nuisance of continually
dragging him before the bench; and he might
get a lot of your men as witnesses against
you; and even if he did no good for himself,
he would do you considerable injury, by drawing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
the men away from their work."</p>

<p>"I never have any bother in that way," replied
Dr. Graham. "I told you I never allow
any of my fellows to have witnesses, if I can
help it, and I generally can; so you see I don't
lose their time in that way; and as to their
being of any service to the fellow who wants
to complain, I don't believe it, for I get it all
arranged before their case is heard. You
know, I am generally on the bench myself;
and before we commence business, I, and whoever
may be sitting with me, have a talk over
the cases on the sheet; and, of course, there
being one in my name, I just explain the
matter to the other fellows, and we easily
settle between us what the chap shall have.
So that when my case is called, I sink the
magistrate for the time, and leave the bench
for the witness box, where I give my evidence
and obtain the sentence I require. Only the
last case I had was one brought against me
by a bullock-driver I had employed, and who,
not having done his work as he ought to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
done, I gave a thrashing to, and he summoned
me for assault. Now it happened, the day
my case came on, I was on the bench with
Ned Telford, who had a case against one of
his men; and we arranged between ourselves,
that while he sat to hear and dismiss my case,
I would hear his, and give his fellow a fortnight
in the lock-up. The thing was done as
easily and quietly as possible, without any
trouble or annoyance to either of us. What
is the use of 'the Master and Servants Act' if
we can't make the fellows obedient? It is
high time that the blackguards were brought
to their senses, for they have had their own
way far too long, and I don't half so much
trouble myself with them now as I used to
do; they begin to know me, and understand
that I will not put up with any of their
nonsense."</p>

<p>"You certainly," said Brown, "manage to
keep them pretty subordinate so long as they
stay with you, which, I imagine, is not longer
than they can help; but, for my own part,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
I am not so fortunate, for I am continually
having trouble with my men. They are principally
'fresh emigrants,' and are always
grumbling and growling, notwithstanding
that they get higher wages than other men,
and have less to do than usually falls to the
lot of older hands. I begin to find that 'new
chums' are the worst class of men that can be
had; I would sooner have black fellows if
they could be got to stick to their work."</p>

<p>"So would I," replied the Doctor, "if we
could only make the black devils work, but
that no one on earth can do. You see we are
obliged to get new chums, at least I am, for
the old ones disappear somehow; as soon as
ever they get paid off, they bolt off down the
country, and we see no more of them."</p>

<p>"Just so, Graham," said the other, "I find it
equally as difficult to get men that have colonial
experience as you do. The fact of the
matter is simply this, some fools particularly
busy themselves in spreading reports down
the country that the blacks are fearfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
troublesome in this district, and that no
man's life is safe; the consequence of which
is, that no one will engage to come out here
but 'new chums,' who have not had time to
hear the idle stories. I hear that emigration
from home is likely to cease from the representations
of a set of scoundrels in Sydney
and Melbourne that the destitution there is
great. If emigration is stopped, I don't know
what we, in the outlying district, are to do
for labour; what do you think Smithers?"</p>

<p>"I think," replied that individual, "that if
the people in the large towns complain of the
scarcity of work it is only because they won't
go into the country to look for it. The fools
won't stir out of the town, notwithstanding
that there are too many of them there, and
that their labour is wanted in the country.
If the blackguards will not come into the
bush when work is offered to them I would
send them to work on the government roads."</p>

<p>"Yes, by Jove! you are right," said
Brown; "but then that can't be done without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
some stringent enactment of government;
which I am certain would be afraid to go in
so heavily. One thing is very certain, labour
we must have of some sort or another; for at
present we are not only at the mercy of our
men, but we have to pay them ruinously high
wages, to be treated with contumely, have
our work neglected, and our property sacrificed."</p>

<p>"For my part," said the Doctor, "I would
sooner have the old convict times back again;
then we could compel the fellows to do their
work, and keep very civil too, unless they
wanted a little buttering with the lash.
Besides, it was far more satisfactory to have
the scoundrels under our control, and not so
expensive as paying the men, as now, forty
and fifty pounds a year and their rations;
but, halloo! who have we got here?"</p>

<p>The last remark in the preceding chapter
was elicited by the appearance of a stranger,
who, at the moment of its utterance, rode up
to the station, and knocked at the open door
of the house. Upon being desired in the
stentorian voice of the owner of the place,
from the room in which he sat, to "come in,"
a rather gentlemanly-looking man of about
the middle height and relative age, presented
himself before the conclave; and said: "I
have to apologize, gentlemen, for intruding
upon your privacy; have I the pleasure of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
addressing Dr. Graham?"</p>

<p>"That is my appellation," replied the individual
in question.</p>

<p>"And mine, sir, is Moffatt, of the Sydney
firm of that name, wool-buyers; possibly it
may be known to you. I am purchasing
wool, and if you have not already disposed of
your clip, will be happy to make you an offer.
I have come over-land, right through the New
England district, and having consumed more
time on the road than I intended, I find I am
rather late for the stations in these northern
parts; they having got most of their clips
away."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I have got mine off too; all but
a few bales," replied the proprietor of Clintown.</p>

<p>"If you have not already made any arrangements
relative to its disposal," remarked
the buyer, "I can judge of your clip by what
you have remaining, and make you an offer
for the whole; and, if we come to terms, you
can intimate the sale to your agents before its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
arrival at port, and instruct them to deliver it
to my order."</p>

<p>"All right," exclaimed the squatter, "we'll
talk about business presently; join us in a
nobbler, there is the bottle. You will find a
glass over there," and he pointed to an
hermaphrodite piece of furniture, standing at
one side of the room.</p>

<p>The stranger thanked his host, and taking
his seat, while he assisted himself to a "stiff
ball," said, "Pray, don't let me disturb the
conversation that you were engaged in at
the moment of my abrupt entrance."</p>

<p>"Well," said Brown, "to resume our topic, I
differ from you Doctor. I don't think we, even
as a class, would be benefited by a return of
the old penal system, and I will tell you why.
In the first place, I don't believe that their
labour was cheaper than that of free men, for
never could the convicts be made to do a
proper amount of work; they had no will to
do so. What they did was only what the
compulsory system had the power of enforcing;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
just so much as not to be actual idleness,
which they were only too ready to indulge
in when they momentarily escaped the strict
surveillance of the overseers; who frequently
were necessarily men of their own class, and
connived with them in their derelictions.
Besides, then we were never free from bush-rangers,
and, with all practicable vigilance,
sometimes the convicts would escape to the
bush, and continually place our lives and
properties in danger; so all things considered,
bad as our straits now are, I would not wish
to see a return of the penal times."</p>

<p>"You have forgotten to mention another
drawback to the system," suggested the
stranger, "and that is the immoral influence
such a class of men have upon the community,
and the contamination to which your family
is liable."</p>

<p>"Hang the immoral influence, as you call
it," exclaimed the Doctor; "whose morals are
they going to effect, I should like to know?
Ours? my word! if we can't take care of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
them, I would ask you, who can?"</p>

<p>"By Jove! Graham," exclaimed Smithers,
laughing, "it would be hard for any fellow to
vitiate yours."</p>

<p>At this sally of Bob's, the man of physic
laughed too, and replied: "Well, I mean the
prisoners have only got themselves to mix
with, so what signifies any consideration for
their morals; they can't make themselves
worse than they were when they are first
convicted."</p>

<p>"There, sir, you are mistaken," said Moffatt.
"You will admit that there were many who
were serving their time as convicted felons
who had come to that position by some false
step in life, of which they deeply repented;
but that, being mixed up with the vilest
ruffians indiscriminately, they were subjected
to this immoral influence of which I speak.
We are perfectly aware that many (but for
their one offence) honourable and exemplary
men, who would scorn to do even a mean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
action, as derogatory to their natures, have
been so subjected; and what has been the
result of their contact with these vilest of the
vile&mdash;villains whose hearts and souls were
devoted to the practice of infamy&mdash;wretches,
whose hearts, as Tom Hood said, were "inscribed
with double guilt?" Has it not been
a general debasement, and a levelling in most
instances of the would be virtuous, to the
standard of the despicable criminals themselves?
I know it has been argued by many
that an honourable man would shun the influence
of such; and that the ruffians themselves,
having no kindred feelings with their
conscientious companions, would not trouble
them, but afford the penitent every opportunity
of avoiding a contact. But it was not so.
What escape had a man of feeling, education,
and penitential desire, from society such as
was general among the convicts? None! He
was compelled to endure it; and, upon a perpetual
exhibition of vice and infamy before his
eyes, hearing it highly spoken of, joked upon,
and even lauded, he too frequently ceased to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
abhor it; began by degrees to look upon it
with a callous indifference, and then to acquire,
and practise, what before the very contemplation
of would have been revolting to his
nature; and ultimately he became as hardened
a wretch as any of the rest. I say this was
too frequently the case; and only shows that
there was an immoral influence at work,
even amongst the prisoners themselves. The
employers of the men were sufferers by it
likewise; for, by the cultivation of penitence
in a willing subject, the employer secured the
services of a valuable servant; whereas if the
moral dispositioned man became as debased
as the vile ones he was as unprofitable as
they. But the evils of the system, in a moral
point of view, were more particularly felt by
the employers in the fearful example made to
their families. Just picture to yourself rearing
a young family subject to the dreadful
contamination of such a school; the influences
of which tuition all the academies of punctilio
in the universe would be unable to eradicate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
Happily for us, and for posterity, those times
are past and never can nor will return, however
much individuals in certain classes may
desire. The mass of the population would
never permit the re-introduction of such an
incubus on civilisation, Christianity, and
morality; but pardon me, sir, I am warming
on the subject; it is one I have always abhorred,
for I have constantly witnessed its
fearful iniquities."</p>

<p>"What you say," replied Dr. Graham, "may
be all very well with regard to people that
have families and live in towns; but you
must remember that squatters are the stay
of the colony, and must be supported. What
would the colonies be but for their exports
of wool? and how, I would like to know, is
that staple commodity to be obtained if the
squatters are not enabled to procure labour?
At present we pay higher wages than any
other country in the world, notwithstanding
which we cannot get sufficient labour to do
our work. It is a question that affects the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
entire country; for if we do not get labour
our staples will decrease, and that, you will
admit, will be a public calamity. The long and
the short of the matter is simply this, we must
have labour, and the government must exert
itself to procure it. If it does not, we ought
to advocate a return of convicts."</p>

<p>"Well, sir," replied Moffatt, "I don't pretend
to dictate to you personally, presuming that
you are the best judge of your own affairs.
Wages in the colonies are certainly high, but
then the employers can well afford to pay the
high rates; and, but in these remote parts, I
have heard few complaints of the scarcity of
labour. Until your district becomes more
settled you will have to expect it, for it is
one of the inconveniences of an unsettled
country; but as soon as it becomes better
known and more occupied, I think you will
find that labour, as in everything else where
there is a supply and demand, will find its
own level."</p>

<p>"That's very true," said Brown, "but, remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
in the meantime, we are sufferers;
what are we to do?"</p>

<p>"I can scarcely tell you," said the other,
"but fear you will have to put up with it.
It is, as I have said, a contingent incidental on
your remote location. You can't force labourers
to settle in a country, of which they know
little, and that little disparaging. You must
offer some inducements to tempt men out
into these wilds other than high wages.
What militates considerably against you, I
imagine, is the current belief that the blacks
are rather dangerous neighbours."</p>

<p>"It is all very well for people that are not
affected as we are, to tell us we must put up
with it," said Brown; "but, assuming that
labour would find its own level as you state;
that is, I imagine, by offering security against
the blacks, if we admitted that the blacks
were dangerous (though we deny it); does it
not follow, that we, in these districts, are entitled
to some consideration on the part of
our rulers? We contribute to the support of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
the state, and are therefore entitled to protection
from the government; but are we
likely to get that? I don't believe it. We
are just allowed to struggle on as best we can.
But it will result in this; we will have to
take the remedy into our own hands; labour
we must have, and if our own countrymen
will not accept our employment, even at
exorbitant wages, we will have to procure it
from some foreign source."</p>

<p>"May I enquire," said Mr. Moffatt, "the
source you would propose?"</p>

<p>"It is immaterial which," replied Brown;
"whatever would be found the most advantageous,
the people that would be most
industrious, and whose labour could be obtained
at the cheapest rate of wage. I have
often been at a loss to understand why the
Victorian government has adopted such
stringent laws to endeavour to keep the
Chinese out of Melbourne. They are essentially
an industrious class of people, and just
the very sort of men we want; they make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
excellent shepherds, more attentive to their
work than Europeans, less difficult to please
in their rations, and can be obtained at far
less wages."</p>

<p>"I can enlighten you," said the wool-buyer,
"if you are ignorant as to the reason of the
Victorian people desiring a restriction on the
immense influx of Chinese immigrants. They
have been landed in that colony in thousands,
and may be said, though forming an integral
part of our population, to be a distinct people
and nation. They speak their own language
only, have their own religion, are proverbially
the laziest, filthiest, and most immoral people
contained in the state, and come without their
females. So that they do not settle amongst
us; but those that are sufficiently fortunate
to make money return with their gains to
their own country to excite the avarice of
their countrymen; while those that are not
successful are left to starve and die, or commit
depredations on our settlers. They swarm
together in large numbers in small tenements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
in our large towns; and, by their vice and
filth, generate noisome diseases amongst
themselves, and pestilence in the neighbourhood
in which they live; and their abodes
and their persons are alike mephitic. They
are in fact the scum of our population, and
far more degraded even than the denizens of
the vilest purlieus of Britain's metropolis.
They, as doubtless you are aware, live and
migrate in large bodies, from one to other of
the diggings, blighting each locality in their
transient passage, as swarms of locusts. They
stab one another, and commit murder amongst
themselves, of which the authorities never
hear. They commit depredations on the
whites, for which they are never punished
from the difficulty in detecting the delinquent;
and, as I said before, they spread disease
wherever they go. They are therefore no
benefit to the country; for, with the exception
of rice and opium, they consume no mercantile
commodities, but annually drain a
considerable quantity of gold from it. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
considering these facts, and that they are
filling places that could be advantageously
occupied by our own countrymen, that the
colonists of Victoria have attempted to restrict
their entrance into the country, by the
exaction of a ten pound poll-tax. I am only
sorry to see that the example is not followed
by the other colonies, for while Victoria stands
alone, she will never succeed in keeping the
evil away."</p>

<p>"And I am very glad to think the other
colonies are liberal-minded enough not do so,"
said Brown. "You will please to bear in mind
that this is a free country, and it is a lasting
disgrace to Victoria that she refuses admission
to any foreigner. The government of Great
Britain might as well attempt to exclude
certain people or classes from the asylum of
her shores."</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied Moffatt, "there it does
not signify. Her own population would more
than counterbalance any influx; but here it is
different. The news of our gold fields, spread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
by rumour, and the return of successful diggers
to China, have generated a spirit of adventure
in that country which shows itself in the
emigration of swarms of her people to our
shores. Already as many as sixty thousand
Chinamen are in Victoria; and they being
acknowledged an inferior and by no means
desirable class of settlers, even if they remained,
it was deemed expedient to stop or
at least check their immigration. As the
complaint was desperate, so, necessarily, was
the remedy. As you say their entrance into
the country could not be prohibited, so the
tax was levied on them to discourage their
coming."</p>

<p>"And I think it was a most iniquitous
tax," said Brown. "It has been urged against
the Chinamen that they consume nothing but
rice, and that on the diggings they are in the
way of British colonization. Now it is a
proverbial fact that they are ousted from all
good 'claims;' which, if of any value, are
instantly 'jumped' by the diggers, while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
poor Chinamen are forced to take up the
abandoned and worked out 'claims,' where
Europeans have found a continuation of
labour unprofitable. On the yield from these
holes they manage to live, so it is evident
that instead of their being a curse to the
country, as has been affirmed, they are positively
a benefit; for the gold, if they do
take any out of the country, is only that
which, but for them, would never have been
extracted from the earth."</p>

<p>"That is a perfect fallacy," replied the
other; "Chinamen will no more work on
bad ground than white men; and as to their
working abandoned 'claims' that is a thing
that is done every day now; for formerly,
when the diggings were in their glory, claims
yielding what would now be considered
'paying quantities,' were thrown up by their
holders for some more promising ground.
But in these times diggers are content to try
over all the old ground; so the assertion that
the practice is confined to the Chinese is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
fallacious."</p>

<p>"However, be it as it may," said Brown,
"the Chinese have a perfect right to come
here if they please; and I should like to see
them landing in Moreton Bay in as many
thousands as they do in Melbourne. Then
we should have an opportunity of getting
shepherds, whereas now we experience considerable
difficulty. Some of the settlers on
the northern part of the coast have for sometime
agitated the question of the introduction
of coolie or Chinese labour into those
parts; arguing that the climate is admirably
adapted for the growth of cotton and sugar,
though too tropical for the European to labour
at agriculture in the sun. It would, however
suit those accustomed to such a temperature;
and without them the resources of the country
will never be developed. I perfectly agree
with them, and think the introduction of
some cheap labour, such as that, would be of
immense advantage to the country."</p>

<p>"I must again differ from you, sir," said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
stranger; "their introduction would be of
incalculable mischief to the entire colony."</p>

<p>"How so?" asked the other, "will you
explain?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied Mr Moffatt; "it would
little matter to you, perhaps, who only want
to realise your fortune, and return with it
to your native land. But how different is it
with the labouring man who settles here with
the intention of making this his home for the
remainder of his days? Let us consider the
prospect it offers to the colony in this light.
It is argued that the northern parts of this
island are possessed of a climate that will not
admit of the manual labour of Europeans; and
that without the introduction of tropical
labour the country must remain unproductive.
Now, admitting this theory, it naturally
follows that, with the exception of owners of
property and capitalists, the population would
be a mixed and foreign one; and would form
a state peculiar in itself, and different in its
language and manners from the other colonies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
This, be it remembered, in the midst of a
British colony, inhabited by the Anglo-Saxon
race. Now, it must be manifest that this
people, forming no inconsiderable part of our
population, must be either admitted to the
privileges of British subjects, or governed as a
conquered race or an inferior people. Assuming,
then, that they are to be recognised as a
class of free immigrants, which is in accordance
with your own opinion, they at once
become colonists, over whose actions we have
no undue control. They would be entitled to
all the privileges of our constitution, and, consequently,
could not be debarred the exercise
of the franchise. To say nothing of the absurdity
of having a Chinaman or coolie returned
to a seat in our legislature, and other
incongruities; what would be the effect of
their introduction upon our own working population?
we will see. This desirable class of
labourers with whom you desire to inundate
us, we will assume, are introduced into the
country in swarms, ostensibly for the cultivation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
of tropical produce in the northern latitudes
of this colony. They are engaged at
wages commensurate to the exigencies of competition,
so as, as you say, to enable the cultivator
to develop the resources of the country
by raising a marketable commodity to compete
with the slave-grown produce of the
western hemisphere. What is the result? Is
it to our advantage? Certainly not! The
value of our exports are increased, you say,
but at what a fearful sacrifice? Granted that
these coolies are engaged, and for a period of
years say, and that they are bound stringently
by penalties to the terms of their agreement.
To enforce this, or even to carry on your work,
you must have the services of some interpreter;
at whose mercy you must ever be, even
if you are so fortunate as to obtain one. I
would ask you, then, what security have you
for the due performance of your labourers' contract?
None but their agreement. And how
can you in a court of law prove its legality,
or the liability of the contracting party, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
that party is totally unacquainted with your
language and you with his; and he does not
admit its validity? But even granting that
one or two refractory coolies could be subdued,
where would be your remedy if scores or hundreds
repudiated their contracts, and refused to
work for you at the wages offered to them?
That they would so refuse I am firmly convinced,
for we are all aware that two differently
remunerated classes of labour of the same description
co-existent is incompatible with the
laws that govern commerce; and men would
be found, as you yourself have admitted, who
would be ready to obtain their services in
other capacities by the offer of higher wages;
while the coolies, in their turn, would readily
accept an improvement in their positions,
without considering the violation of their contract,
the nature of which they would doubtless
have but an imperfect idea, if not be
entirely ignorant. Thus they would be continually
drawn off from their intended occupation
to fill positions to the exclusion of the
white man; and the cotton and sugar cultivator<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
would require to give an equivalent to
the European's wages, or supply the places of
those who abscond by a fresh importation. In
such an emergency it is more than probable
that the latter would be the course adopted.
Hence we would have a perpetual influx of these
undesirable immigrants, who would merely
serve a probationary term with their importers,
and then mix with our white population
on terms of equality. Is it not evident then
that Asiatic labour would be brought into
direct competition with European? and who
can deny that the result would not be disastrous
to the latter? Some strait-laced
philosophers and fireside philanthropists, who
see the miseries of their fellow-creatures
through the beeswing of their after-dinner
potations, dictate the means for the amelioration
of the sufferings of their race with the
same self-sufficient spirit that they rule the
destinies of their own household. These
argue that the introduction of the heathen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
immigrants to our shores would be an inestimable
blessing to humanity, and add an
additional lustre to the cause of Christianity,
by the intercourse of the two races, and a consequent
enlightenment and christianizing of
the disciples of feticism. But this I deny, for
debase the European labourer by reducing his
means to that of the Asiatic (which I affirm
would be the consequence of this influx), and
instead of the latter being elevated to the level
of the former, the former would be rather
dragged down to that of the latter. Without
going so far as to question the omnipotence of
the Almighty I firmly believe that the moral
condition of the Asiatic would not be ameliorated
in the slightest degree by the contact;
while humanity and Christianity would receive
a blow in the demoralization of our
countrymen. Depend upon it, sir, the expediency
of the introduction of cheap labour
is a fallacy; whereas the very existence of our
religion, and the realization of our future
greatness, depend upon the settlement of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
wastes of our colony by a thorough British
population."</p>

<p>"But, my good sir," said Brown, "how do
you reconcile to your objection the thesis
that, as the European cannot labour in field
service in the tropical heat of the northern
part of our colony, without the assistance of
Asiatic labour the productions of our land
will lay dormant?"</p>

<p>"That," replied the other, "I also deny. I
believe European labour is practicable in our
climate, even in the remote north; and in
support of my belief I could name numerous
precedents. Was it not a Spanish population
that peopled South America? an European
that later settled Texas? and is even now (I
allude more particularly to the Germans)
growing cotton in that province to compete
with the slave-grown produce of the States?
Have not the French settled Algiers, and
cultivated its soil, even producing that desired
staple, cotton? But to come nearer home;
have not our own brave countrymen in India<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
incontestably proved, in the trials of the last
fearful campaign, without having been inured
to the climate, the capability of the Englishman
to withstand its heat?"</p>

<p>"But still," said Brown, "the price at which
we purchase our labour would never enable us
to cultivate either sugar or cotton profitably.
We must have cheap labour to perform the
work; and, for my own part, I can't see but
that, if coolies be introduced into the country
as labourers for a specific purpose, they could
be compelled by the law of the land to continue
at that labour. If the introduction for
that purpose is found desirable, the practice
of their immigration could be legalized by an
enactment that at the same time would bind
them to the species of work for which they
were engaged, and make their hire or employment
for any other purpose, or in any other
part of the country beyond the tropical
boundary, a felony punishable by a heavy
penalty."</p>

<p>"That was just the point I was coming to,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
replied Mr. Moffatt; "but first I will answer
your previous objection. It is practicable for
Europeans to cultivate the soil to the northward,
though they will do so in the manner
most advantageous to themselves. If they
find the cultivation of cotton and sugar unprofitable
they will turn their attention to other
products; but I am inclined to believe that
cotton could be profitably cultivated even by
our own expensive labour. I have a friend,
resident in the vicinity of Brisbane, who has
grown some cotton as an experiment, and the
result, even in this temperate climate, has been
most satisfactory. The cotton he sent home
was submitted to some of the first judges in
Manchester and Liverpool, who pronounced
it of the finest sea-island description, and
superior to any obtained from the United
States. Now this cotton was cultivated from
the ordinary American sea-island seed; so that
its fineness arose, not from any excellence in
its germ, but the peculiar adaptation and
efficiency of the soil in which it was grown;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
and which does not differ from the land on
our entire coast line. This shows that our
cotton would be of superior quality, and consequently
of greater value. Another fact to
be remembered is this, that in 'the States,'
owing to the frost and severity of the winter,
the plant is only an annual; while with us,
as my friend has discovered, from the absence
of frost the cotton tree becomes a perennial,
and increases its yield each season; while the
staple does not deteriorate in quality. Thus,
it will be seen, we should have considerable
advantage in the cost of production over the
American planter; notwithstanding his slave
labour. But to return to the coolies; with regard
to their forced compliance with the terms
of their agreements,&mdash;to effect which, you say,
certain enactments would have to be passed
to meet the exigencies of the case,&mdash;I believe
the first step would be the dismemberment of
those districts from the parent colony, and
their erection into a separate state; so as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
to preserve the stringencies necessary in its
government from infringing the constitution
of the other colonies. Now in this new state
the preponderance of the population would be
black, who would in fact comprise all the
working part of it; and it would necessarily
follow that the government of the state
would be comprised of the employers of this
very labour, their servants, or sycophants, or
at least those whose interests would be intimately
connected with theirs. So that they
might be necessarily expected to legislate so
as to entirely meet their own views, and
subvert the rights and freedom of their
foreign labourers. The system would then
descend into a compulsory labour; and, but
for its name, would in nowise differ from
slavery; worse in fact than actual slavery,
from the fact of the stimulus of protection to
one's own property being wanting in this case,
that would in the other act as a preventive
against unusual tyranny and oppression. So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
that the right of disposal by death, might
reasonably be expected, would be exercised
almost with impunity. Depend upon it, sir,
such a system would give rise to a state of
things, not only deplorable, but derogatory
to a Christian nation. But I am convinced it
never would gain the countenance or consent
of the home government, who, for its own
honour, could not tolerate the introduction of
coolie labour on such terms; and our own
population would never suffer its introduction
on terms of equality."</p>

<p>"Well, sir," replied Brown, "though I don't
admit myself a convert to your way of thinking,
I still believe there is some truth in your
arguments; but the thing we can't get over
is the want of a labouring population here
in the bush; and if we can't induce our own
countrymen to emigrate we must try others."</p>

<p>"Believe me, sir," said Mr. Moffatt, "it is
not a want of inclination that deters thousands
of Britain's redundant population from
flocking to our shores; it is the supineness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
of our short-sighted government, who, instead
of creating a fund for the introduction of an
agricultural population by the sale of the
waste lands of the colony, or by the grant to
every immigrant of a piece of land equivalent
in value to the amount he has paid for
his passage, lock up the lands from agricultural
settlers in the fear lest their interests
should clash with the pastoral. This suicidal
policy has long been manifest; in no way
more so than by the fact that we are obliged
to depend upon a foreign supply for our very
articles of common consumption; whereas
nowhere could they be produced with greater
advantage than within our own territory. By
all accounts you are likely, in this district,
to be separated from New South Wales; and
one of your first acts in your legislative
independence should be to facilitate the
settlement of your agricultural lands. The
two interests, that and the pastoral, may be
separately maintained without detriment to
either, and with immense advantage to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
state."</p>

<p>"Oh, hang these politics!" cried Graham;
"sink all dry arguments just now, you have
made me quite thirsty with merely hearing
your clatter. Never mind the agricultural
lands, coolies, or Chinamen, though I would
be very happy to see them and hope we will
be able to get a supply of them soon. We
will just polish off another bottle of grog,
while we screw a spree out of Smithers here."
With this little prologue he left the room for
a few minutes, returning with a bottle which
he placed on the table, and took his seat
while he continued: "Bob tells me he is going
to 'put his foot into it.' You know he has
long been engaged to that niece of Rainsfield's
(a deuced fine girl, by Jove!), and he states he
is to be married in about a month. Now I
say, if he does not give us a spree before he
throws us overboard, we will cut him as dead
as a herring after he is 'spliced.' What do
you say, Brown?"</p>

<p>"Most assuredly," replied that individual,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
"Smithers ought to entertain his bachelor
friends before he withdraws himself from
their clique; and I have no doubt he will."</p>

<p>"He tells me too," said the Doctor, "that
those young fellows at Fern Vale have behaved
scurvily to him, that one of them has
tried to cut him out, and striven hard to set
the girl against him. Now I would propose
that Smithers give a spree at Brompton, and
get his brother to invite the guests for him;
then he would be able to have his girl and
her friends there, and these young Fergusons
too. We could have some glorious fun, get
up some races or something of that sort, to
please the women and amuse ourselves; besides,
it would answer the purpose of showing
off his girl and introducing her to his friends,
at the same time that it would annoy his
rival. And for the matter of that we might
oblige him by picking a quarrel with young
Ferguson, and giving the fellow a good drubbing,
just for the satisfaction of the thing.
Eh, gad! Bob must promise to give us a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
spree, or we won't let him out of this house.
It is not often one of our fellows gets spliced;
and we can't lose one without a jollification.
You had better promise at once, Bob."</p>

<p>"Well, for my part," replied Bob, "I would
give you a spree in a minute, but how am I
to get it up? I would not know who to ask;
and, besides, no one would come to my invitation
except such fellows as you, who would
drink all day, or until you had drained the
house dry of liquor."</p>

<p>"Get your brother to do it," replied the
Doctor, "and work round to the blind side of
his wife. I'll be bound she's woman enough to
join in it heartily; the mere prospect of the
thing will be sufficient inducement to make
her fall into your views; and depend upon it
she will not only undertake the whole affair,
but get together a good company for you."</p>

<p>"But there is another thing," urged Bob,
"if we are to invite fifty or a hundred people
to our place we will have to find quarters for
most of them, and how shall we manage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
that?"</p>

<p>"Nothing easier in the world," replied the
contumacious Doctor; "give up all your spare
room to the women folks, and we fellows can
shake down anywhere, camp under a tree if
you like; or those that don't like that, let
them take the wool-shed."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll see if the thing can be managed,"
replied Bob, "and let you know in good time."</p>

<p>Some few days after the meeting of Doctor
Graham's friends at Clintown the monotony
of the little circle at Fern Vale was disturbed
by the arrival of a horseman with a letter for
Miss Ferguson; who received into her hand
one of those intricately folded missives which
at once proclaim the correspondent to be of
the fair sex, and proceeded to read the
following epistle:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p><blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dearest Kate.</span>&mdash;I'm having a few friends
at Brompton on Friday week to spend the
day, and of course expect to see you and
your brothers of the number. I will take no
excuse, you must come; and, if you can
possibly manage it, I would be delighted by
your prolonging your visit for a week or as
long as you like. However, that I will leave
to yourself. Eleanor and Mrs. Rainsfield I
expect with Tom, so that you will have company
on the road. We will do what we can to
amuse you all day, and you need not make
yourself uneasy about the journey, for I will
have plenty of room in the house for you, as
well as all my friends, and Mr. Smithers will
provide for the accommodation of the gentlemen.
You had better ride over on the
Thursday, and the party will break up comfortably
on the Saturday morning. Tell your
brothers that part of the programme of the
day's pleasures is a race, and as I know that
William at least is fond of racing, he might
like to join in it. The man that carries this</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p><blockquote>

<p>will be able to tell him more about it than I
can, so I will leave him to gain all that information
from him. With warmest love,
believe me, dearest Kate, your affectionate
<span class="word-spacing">friend, </span><span class="smcap">Eliza Smithers.</span></p>

<p>
"<i>Tuesday morning.</i>
</p>

<p>"<i>P. S.</i>&mdash;Write me a reply by the bearer,
and mind as you value my friendship make
no excuses."</p></blockquote>

<p>The delighted girl had no intention of declining
the invitation; for when did a young
and joyous creature in the zenith of youthful
spirits ever desire seclusion from the innocent
enjoyments of life? She ran with the open
letter in her hand to her brother William
(who was at the time a short distance from
the house giving instructions to some of his
men), and cried: "See, Will, here is an invitation
from Mrs. Smithers to a party at
Brompton; you'll go, won't you, Will? I
know you will; I'll go and write an answer
to say we will accept it."</p>

<p>"Don't be in such a violent hurry my little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
Diana; give me time to read the letter," said
her brother, "before you act as sponsor for me.
There is no necessity, my dear, to be so impatient;
I dare say the messenger will wait
for a few minutes;" and then, after perusing
it, he continued: "For my part I will be
delighted to go, though I'll first see what
John says. But, my Kitty! you should not
run out in the sun with your head uncovered;
you will be spoiling your beautiful complexion
and getting a <i>coup de soliel</i>. Then your invitations
to parties would be at an end; be
off now and put on a hat, and we will go look
for John, and get his decision on the question."</p>

<p>The affectionate mandate of her brother,
was soon obeyed by Kate; and the two went
in search of John, to submit the note to his
perusal. After reading it, he expressed a disinclination
to accept the invitation, excusing
himself that as they had determined to
shortly start for New England he had no
wish to join the festivities; but to enable his
brother and sister to go to Brompton, he said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
he would delay his departure until after their
return.</p>

<p>Kate and William endeavoured in vain to
dissuade him from this, but he was inexorable;
so it was at last arranged that they
should join the party without him, and Kate
hastened to communicate the intelligence to
her friend, while William took the opportunity
of eliciting from the Brompton messenger all
the information he could obtain respecting the
arrangements.</p>

<p>The reader may conjecture the motives that
actuated John Ferguson in his desire to keep
aloof from Brompton. He was aware the
marriage of Bob Smithers and Eleanor Rainsfield
was fixed for a period not very remote;
and, perceiving the object of the meet was to
exhibit the young lady to the admiring gaze,
and introduce her to the notice of the friends
of the family as the affianced bride of Bob
Smithers, he wished to avoid a meeting which,
he doubted not, would be irksome to the lady
and painful to himself, especially as he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
be compelled to witness the triumph of his
rival, who, he believed, would take a malicious
pleasure in making him feel his defeat.
He therefore resolved to absent himself from
a society where he was calculated to experience
disappointment, rather than pleasure;
where for him there would be no enjoyment,
except the melancholy satisfaction of gazing
on the features of the one he dearly loved,
but who so shortly was to be the bride of
another. As his brother and sister left him
he resumed the occupation at which he had
been disturbed on their approach, and continued
wrapt in his own gloomy meditations,
until he was aroused from his reverie by
the cheerful voice of Tom Rainsfield calling
him by his name; when turning round he perceived
his friend standing at his side.</p>

<p>"Why, what on earth is the matter with
you, John?" said Tom, as he gazed upon the
sorrowful features of the young man; "you
look ill, wretchedly ill; what ails you, man?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," replied John. "I never felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
better in my life; I am not ailing." But his
looks belied his speech, for his pallid cheek
bore the stamp of a mental depression, and his
haggard features the evidence of sufferings
other than corporeal; for, let the truth be
told, the consciousness that Eleanor was lost
to him for ever, preyed upon his mind; and,
notwithstanding his repeated efforts to rally
his drooping spirits, a melancholy gloom had
settled upon his brow, there giving indication
of the tumult of thought and feeling that had
and still was agitating his brain.</p>

<p>His passion for Eleanor Rainsfield, since
the fire of love had first entered his soul, had
ever been the material of his dreams both by
day and night; she was the star of his destiny,
the cynosure to which the magnetic
needle of his hopes always pointed, and to
which his fondest affections continually looked
for guidance. He loved her madly, and had
half fancied, notwithstanding her avowment
of a pre-engagement, that some fortuitous circumstance
might have transpired to break off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
that connexion, and lead her to join her destinies
with his. He believed he was not altogether
an indifferent object in her eyes, and
the fates, even though hitherto unpropitious,
he had believed would have ultimately favoured
his cause. Thus he continued, even
with his heart under a prohibitory decree, to
cherish the tender feeling for the lovely girl,
although his calmer nature told him there
was no hope. He offered up his mind a willing
sacrifice to the pleasing though deadly
poison, and permitted his soul to be ravished
by the wild delirium of his infatuated love.
He had, in fact, hoped against hope; but now,
that he discovered the creature he adored was
irrevocably passing from him to become the
wife of another, life appeared to him a blank,
and he felt no desire to prolong an existence
expatriated from the society of the only one
who made it dear to him. These were the
feelings that had consumed the spirits of the
young man between the interval of his separation
from his sister and his meeting with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
Tom Rainsfield, and which had left such indubitable
marks of distress on his countenance
that his friend had not failed to detect them.</p>

<p>We say that John Ferguson was aware that
the marriage of Bob Smithers and Eleanor
was settled. This he had heard some time
previously, and the tenor of Mrs. Smithers'
note had confirmed it; while in his susceptive
imagination he pictured to himself the whole
plan, needing no better prompter than his
fears. While there had been a shadow of
hope, John had borne with commendable fortitude
the disappointment of unrequited affection,
and sustained the devastation of the
consuming fire that was burning within him
without the possibility of egress. But now
that the barrier of his expectancy had been
rudely broken down; that the circumvallation
of his breastine citadel had been razed
to the ground, and the delicate fabric of his
heart exposed to the rough greeting of the
unfriendly blast, and the piercing shafts of
despair, his spirit sank under the assault, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
left him crushed and almost demented.</p>

<p>"Why, man," said Tom, "you look the perfect
picture of misery. I know, or can guess,
the cause of your grief; but never mind, cheer
up, old fellow! You know the old adage:
'The battle is never lost till it's won;' so
do not despair. Eleanor is not married yet,
and, by Jove! she won't be either; at least
to Smithers; you mark my words."</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," said John, "do not destroy
her happiness or peace of mind by
attempting to separate her from her betrothed.
He is her choice, and it is her pleasure to
accept him; then what have I to complain of?
Pray, don't frustrate her marriage with
Smithers out of any regard for me; for I feel
convinced any intrigue you may enter into
to further such an object would be distasteful
to her."</p>

<p>"Not at all," replied his friend; "you mistake
her, John, and me too, and I may add
yourself as well. Though Eleanor has given
her consent to this arrangement I know her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
heart is not with it. Do you think I would
be disappointing her, or making her miserable,
by destroying a bond that would only bind
her in a state of abject misery for the entire
period of her life? Would I not rather be
justified in rescuing her from such a condition?
Of course I would. Then that is the reason
I object to her marriage with Smithers; for I
am certain she would never know a day's
happiness from the hour of her union with
him. Two natures never were more diametrically
opposed to one another; the dove and
the hawk might as well be allied as she to
him. She all purity, virtue, and innocence;
he all licentiousness, vice, and depravity,
without the capacity to appreciate so priceless
a gem, and I believe without one feeling of
regard for her. No, by&mdash;I was going to
swear; but, never mind, it cannot be, and I
say it shall not be; I'll prevent it yet, for I
am sworn to it."</p>

<p>"I fear, Tom," said John Ferguson, "you
are disposed to judge too harshly of Smithers;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
Eleanor evidently sees something in him that
she admires, or I imagine she would not accept
him; so I would beg of you again to leave
her to the dictates of her own feelings. Much
as I should desire to be blessed by the possession
of her hand, I would not attempt it
by an opposition to her own inclinations."</p>

<p>"Well, John," replied the other, "I am really
surprised to hear you talk so if you love
Eleanor, as I am convinced you do. For her
sake, as well as for your own, you will save
her from the misery of so unnatural an
alliance as this she meditates. It cannot but
terminate unhappily, for I am sure Smithers'
treatment of her will be on a par with his
general conduct, selfish and brutal."</p>

<p>"Pray, don't imagine, my dear Tom," continued
John Ferguson, "that I am advocating
his cause out of opposition to you, or of
perverseness to my own interests. I would
consider it the <i>acme</i> of human felicity to be
possessed of so inestimable a treasure as
Eleanor Rainsfield; but, next to the happiness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
of that possession, my desire is to see her
happy. Bearish as Smithers may be, and I
believe is, it will be impossible for him to
witness the devotion of such a gentle heart as
hers without being warmed in the sunshine
of her affection. He cannot but treat her
with love and respect, for her nature would
command them even from the breast of a
savage."</p>

<p>"No doubt it would," said Tom, "but I
believe that Bob Smithers has not got the
feelings of a savage except in his barbarity.
But, come John, this won't do; I can't see
you perseveringly standing in your own light,
and, instead of arousing yourself to exertion,
indulging in melancholy reflections. You
must be stimulated to work the release of that
girl. Why, man, you have lost her through
your own supineness. Do you think if I had
loved a girl as you have Eleanor, that I
would have cared about all the Bob Smithers'
in the colony. I would never have ceased
my importunities, until I had induced her to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
look favourably upon me, and condemn her
other suitor. You know the saying that the
constant dropping of water will wear away
the stone; and if I had not worn a hole into
her heart, it is a wonder; especially if my
rival was such a careless wooer as Smithers;
and when once I had got her to prefer me to
him, Bob Smithers, or Bob anybody else,
might have gone to Jericho for me. I'll bet
I'd have soon choked him off; but, my dear
fellow, let me see you put a bright face upon
the matter, and thrust your foot through
'Bob's affair'; for I am convinced it does
not require much to turn the scale in your
favour even now, notwithstanding all Eleanor's
scruples. The girl must be yours, so
take heart."</p>

<p>A sickly smile was the only response Tom
got from his friend for this attempt to rally
him, but he continued: "Well, look here,
John, if you don't exert yourself to avert
what I consider a domestic calamity I shall
cease to consider you my friend. I never saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
one who so pertinaciously adhered to a despondency,
without attempting to extricate
himself, as you. William tells me you have
declined the invitation to Brompton. Now, I
must insist upon your going; I'll take you
under my especial care, and will engage to
bring about something to your advantage."</p>

<p>"I am extremely indebted to you for your
sympathy, Tom," said his friend; "but I
regret I have a pre-engagement to start for
New England before that time; and I fear
to delay my journey much longer as the
weather threatens to break."</p>

<p>"Now, you know that is all nonsense," said
Tom; "I am going down to town myself in a
few days, and a day or two will make no
more difference to you than to me. I know
the object of your refusal, so that excuse
won't serve. Why should you desire to avoid
the Smitherses or ourselves? It is true Bob
has behaved to you in a most ungentlemanly
manner, but you need not notice him; the
invitation comes from his brother and lady,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
and you may be sure he will be compelled to
treat you with civility. With regard to our
party, you need not be under any apprehension;
Mrs. Rainsfield, Eleanor, and myself
will form our cavalcade, so you may anticipate
no unpleasantness by the chance of meeting
my brother. While, if I judge rightly, our
going ought to be an inducement to you, for
of course we shall join to make one party on
the road."</p>

<p>"I really can't go," said John.</p>

<p>"I'll hear of no objection," replied Tom;
"you must go, unless you wish to displease
all of us by your moroseness. Besides, bear
in mind that your absence will give Bob
Smithers an opportunity of glorying over
your defeat. If it is only to oppose him I
would urge you to come; and make yourself
as agreeable to Eleanor as you can."</p>

<p>"I have already declined the invitation,"
said John, "and I doubt not ere this the
messenger has returned with Kate's reply;
so it would be unbecoming of me to go after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
my refusal."</p>

<p>"Moonshine!" exclaimed Tom. "Who
would ever think of studying etiquette with
our friends in the bush? Besides your apology
is a difficulty easily remedied, for the man is
going to stop at our place all night; so we
can get your sister to write another note, and
I will take it over to him, and exchange it for
the one he has; we may therefore consider
that arranged, and that you go."</p>

<p>"I will go to please you," said John; "but
I can assure you I have little pleasure in the
prospect."</p>

<p>"Well, you are a stubborn and ungrateful
fellow," exclaimed Tom Rainsfield. "I have
a good mind to repeat that remark to Eleanor,
unless you promise me to make amends by
being assiduously attentive to her, despite all
frowns of another."</p>

<p>"I fear," replied John, "that is a difficult
task; however, I'll attempt that also to please
you."</p>

<p>"That's right, my dear fellow," cried Tom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
"that's the first sensible thing I have heard
you utter for some time, and inclines me to
entertain some hopes of you yet. But come
let us join your sister and William; we will
talk over our plans, and set the young lady
to work on her letter."</p>

<p>The two young men then sauntered quietly
up to the house, and Tom Rainsfield taking
the lead entered first, and addressed Kate
Ferguson in his lively manner as he did so.</p>

<p>"I have been successful, my dear Miss
Ferguson," he said, "in making a convert of
John. I have overruled all his objections to
join us, and he has promised to accompany
our party to Brompton. So we have to beg
of you to concoct another epistle for Mrs.
Smithers, which I will be the bearer of to the
Brompton messenger, who is to remain at our
place all night."</p>

<p>Kate instantly sprang from her seat, and
clapped her hands with delight; then running
to her brother threw her arms round his neck
and kissed him, gazing in his eyes as she said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
"I am so delighted, dear John, that you are
coming with us. You have been looking so
melancholy of late that I have felt quite
wretched to see you; but you will be pleased
with the visit, I know you will, and happy
too; will you not, John?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear," he replied, "but am I not
always happy?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied the affectionate
girl; "but I hardly think you are always so.
Are you really happy now, John? You do
not look so."</p>

<p>"But I am, my love," said he; "how could
I be otherwise?"</p>

<p>"Of course not," said Tom; "I should like
to know what fellow would not be happy when
he had a pair of delicate little arms affectionately
flung round his neck, a brace of
luscious little ruby lips pouting to his, and
warbling the sweet music of affection, and
with two lovely eyes peering into his dull
orbs. By Jove! the very thought of it ought
to make him happy; and it is my firm conviction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
that he has been showing all this
opposition just to be tempted in that way.
I only wish I could induce any little charmer
to try the same experiment on me. I would
be incessantly wanting an application of the
persuasive influence. Do you desire me to
join the party, Miss Ferguson?"</p>

<p>"Of course, we do," replied the young lady;
"we couldn't well do without you."</p>

<p>"Then I've determined not to go," replied
Tom. "Neither Mrs. Rainsfield nor Eleanor
care much about my company, so I think I'll
absent myself."</p>

<p>This palpable hit of Tom's was rewarded by
a hearty laugh from John, and a blush and an
ejaculation of "you horrid man," from the damsel;
who pouted her lips, and attempted to
frown, while she went to her little writing-desk
to pen a revised edition of her note of the morning.
Her anger, however, as Tom well knew,
was only assumed and of short duration, and
after a few moments of attempted frigidity
she said smilingly: "You are really incorrigibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
rude, Mr. Rainsfield, and you may
depend upon it I will tell Eleanor of your
impertinence."</p>

<p>"My dear young lady," replied the delinquent,
"that would be nothing new to her;
she is already fully acquainted with my peculiarities,
and would probably recommend you
to try the effect of your balm."</p>

<p>"Why, you are getting worse than ever,
you insolent fellow," cried Kate. "I'll really
get angry with you, and forbid you accompanying
us, which I am sure, notwithstanding
your statement of indifference, would be a
severe punishment. But leave me alone a few
minutes pray, until I write my letter; and
then I will expect you to apologize to me for
your bad behaviour."</p>

<p>"I will be as dumb as a dormouse," exclaimed
Tom, "until you have completed your
task, so proceed; or, perhaps, you would like
to employ me as your amanuensis. I will
be happy to be of service to you."</p>

<p>"Then be good enough to hold your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
tongue," said Kate, "you are not fulfilling
your promise of silence."</p>

<p>"No; but I am merely making a suggestion
for your benefit," said Tom.</p>

<p>"You are positively dreadful," cried Kate;
"you men, insolent fellows! are continually
talking of women's tongues; but, I declare,
no woman could have one that is kept so unceasingly
occupied as yours, for you give it no
rest; even when you are requested to do so,
and when you actually make the attempt."</p>

<p>"You shall have no further cause to complain,"
said Tom; "I will be silent until you
finish your letter; that is, if you do not occupy
as much time as is necessary to pen a
government dispatch. Ladies' specimens of
chirography are proverbially voluminous, are
as vague as an electioneering address, and
require as much attention and time in their
composition and execution, as if each individual
epistle was of the greatest moment of
their lives."</p>

<p>"Hush! for goodness sake," exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
Kate; "when will you stop? pray be silent
for a few minutes, and then you may talk as
much as you like."</p>

<p>The desired truce was at length obtained,
and the letter written and handed to Tom for
delivery.</p>

<p>"Now," said he, "where has William gone?
we ought to have him here to discuss plans;
however, I daresay, you, Miss Ferguson, John,
and I, can manage. What I would propose
is this; that you all come over to Strawberry
Hill the night before, and start thence the
first thing in the morning; for I fear that
you, Miss Ferguson, will find that fifty
miles will be quite far enough to ride in one
day, and Brompton is very nearly that from
our place."</p>

<p>"That proposition I should decidedly object
to," said John; "it would not be consistent
to intrude ourselves upon your brother. The
extra distance between this and your place
will be of little consequence, especially as
Kate is a good horsewoman, and I am sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
will think nothing of the distance."</p>

<p>"Very likely not," replied Tom; "but consider
a young lady cannot be expected to be
ready for a journey so early as you would, and
to do it comfortably you should start from
here at daybreak. Be reasonable now for once,
John, and if you won't come yourself let
William bring your sister over the day before,
and leave her that night with Eleanor. You
can pick her up as you pass on Thursday
morning, while we will join company, and all
proceed together. What do you say to that
arrangement, Miss Ferguson?"</p>

<p>"I should like it very much," replied Kate;
"but I will do whatever John wishes. If he
does not desire me to stop at your house I
will endeavour to ride the whole distance in
the day, though I must confess it is rather a
long ride."</p>

<p>"Of course it is," said Tom, "far too long for
you, excellent equestrian though you be; and,
besides, I can't see what objection John can
have to your visiting us. You come as a guest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
to my sister-in-law; therefore, my brother's
quarrel with John should in no way prevent
you from sojourning with us. Waive all
unpleasant feelings, John, and let your sister
stop with us for that night."</p>

<p>"I don't wish to detain her," replied John,
"out of any ill-feeling towards any member of
your family; I am sure you are perfectly
aware of that; but from a feeling that it would
be hardly proper under the circumstances."</p>

<p>"There can be no impropriety in it," said
Tom; "my sister-in-law would be delighted
with the arrangement; in fact, she herself
proposed the scheme to me this morning, when
she received her invitation and heard that
you were expected to go too. To settle the
matter, I'll bring her over here on Thursday,
and she will take Miss Ferguson back with
her; for I know very well you'll not attempt
to dispute the question with her. What do
you say to <i>that</i> arrangement, Miss Ferguson?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I should be so happy to join Eleanor,"
she exclaimed, "and stop with her that night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
if John will let me."</p>

<p>"Of course, he'll let you," replied Tom;
"he has no serious objection I know, but is
only opposing me because you are desirous of
the adoption of my scheme. He wants a
little more of your lip salve, when I'll guarantee
he'll be softened."</p>

<p>"Now, you are mocking me," said Kate;
"it is cruel of you to make fun of my affection
for my brother. I am almost determined
not to have anything farther to say to you;
you are a hard-hearted unfeeling fellow."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, my dear young lady," cried
Tom, "I was only attempting to do faint
justice to your insuperable power of fascination.
One soft embrace, similar to that I
witnessed a short time ago, I am sure will
melt your inexorable brother, who is even
worse to deal with, and requires more coaxing
than any 'stern parient' I ever saw."</p>

<p>"I'll be softened without that this time,"
said John, "as it is Mrs. Rainsfield's desire
that you should break your journey by starting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
from her house, Kate, I have no desire to
oppose your own wish; you may go if you
like, and William and I will join your party
on Thursday morning."</p>

<p>The delighted girl again ran over to her
brother, and sitting on his knee, with her
arms encircling his neck in an amatory embrace,
leant her head on his breast, and looked
roguishly pleased from her dark blue eyes at
Tom, who sat in perfect raptures, gazing at
the lovely seraph.</p>

<p>"Upon my life, Miss Ferguson, you'll be
the death of me," he exclaimed; "how do you
imagine any mortal man can withstand such
temptation? If I witness another scene like
that to-day, I'll lose my senses. I must be
off home, unless you wish to have the weight
on your mind of being the cause of rendering
me a raving maniac."</p>

<p>"I think you are that already, sir," replied
Kate; "for you are always strange in your
manner, and invariably accompany, in your
addresses to me, insults in your flattery."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
But the kind-hearted girl, thinking, even in
her playfulness, she had said something too
harsh, came over and stood by Tom's chair,
and continued in a sweet and kindly voice
and with a smile beaming on her charming
features: "But I will give you full permission
during our visit to Brompton, to say as
many cruel things to me as you like and I
won't be angry. You may flatter me as much
as you please, and I'll pledge you my word
I'll not believe you. So there will be no
occasion for you to take leave of your senses
just at present."</p>

<p>"To live under the smile of your countenance,"
exclaimed Tom, "would be a sufficient
talisman against any evil spirit; so I fear
none of their machinations, and feel sufficiently
armed against that demon lunacy; towards
whom, since I have known you, I have always
had an irresistible tendency."</p>

<p>"Then I should advise you," said Kate, "to
instantly fly my presence."</p>

<p>"That, Miss Ferguson, would only have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
effect of hastening an exacerbation of my
malady; my only hope for relief is in a continuance
of your smiles."</p>

<p>"Your case is certainly a most extraordinary
one," said Kate; "you say your only
relief is from me, and yet I am the cause of
your mental subversion."</p>

<p>"It is not at all extraordinary, my dear
young lady," said Tom; "but perfectly consistent
with the doctrines of pharmacology,
both allopathic and homeopathic, by the principle
embodied in the doctrine of the latter,
viz., '<i>similia similibus curantur</i>.' If your
smiles wound my heart, they are the sweetest
as well as the surest remedy to heal it;
and, if an exhibition of your specious favours
almost drives me to distraction, the balm
whose curative powers is the most effective
is a permission to continue in the thraldom of
your mellifluent bondage."</p>

<p>"Well, now, I declare you are a dreadful
fellow," said Kate, "I did not give you permission
to flatter me until Thursday week,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
but you commence now in spite of me."</p>

<p>"What! is he flirting again, my Kitty?"
said William, as he burst into the room. "Tom,
we will have to send you, like your renowned
namesake, to Coventry. You will be spoiling
our sister, cramming her poor little head with
your love speeches. She will be thinking of
nothing else but those little chubby-faced
winged archers, whose destined occupation is
to traverse the globe with flambeau in hand,
to ignite the inflammable material of mortals'
hearts. And instead of our finding substantial
meals, to satisfy the cravings of our
hunger, we will some day be expected to feed
on the ambrosia of that little mischief-making
deity. Is John superintending your flirting,
my turtle doves?"</p>

<p>A hearty laugh was the response of Tom
Rainsfield to this sally; while John replied
that he had been too much amused at the
farce to interrupt it. Kate, however, took a
different mode of explanation. She advanced
nimbly to her brother and saluted him; not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
in the way she had done to John, but with
an inoffensive titillation on his cheek with
her downy little hand; which she intended,
as she said, for a slap for his impertinence.
"But tell me, Will," said she, "what made
you rush in in such a hurry; was it to
frighten us?"</p>

<p>"Frighten you, my pet?" he replied. "No!
I have got some fun to tell you. A few
minutes ago while I was down at the stock-yard
I had a letter put into my hands by
young Sawyer; but as the missive is an
epistolary production somewhat unique I will
read it to you for your benefit. The orthography
is not at all in harmony with any of
the lexicographers to whom it has been my
fortune at any time to refer; but in open
violation of Dr. Johnson and all his colleagues.
However, that is a minor curiosity, and can
be digested in detail."</p>

<p>"Well, read us the letter," replied his
auditory, "or let us look at it."</p>

<p>"Here it is," said William, as he commenced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
to read it; while we, to give the reader a
better conception of the production, crave
pardon for inserting it verbatim. The superscription
is "Mr. Wm. Fuggishon, Esqe. Farn
Vail per barer," and the contents are:</p>

<p>"Weddingsday, Dare Sir, Exkuse the
libety i take for to rite yer but Capting Jones
and me presints our comblemints and 'ave
to say as how weir agoing to 'ave a partey
on nixt munday and wood be glad if you'd
cum as theril be golley sprey and lots of
gents. be shuer and cum and also yer syster
cos we shal 'ave ladeys to at hour ouse, and
theril be no fears on her getting 'ome agin,
cos I thinks you dosent drink so of corse
you'd not git drunk I am Mr. Fuggishon sir
yours truly Mrs. Capting Jones wat is to be
or Mary ann Sawyer now.</p>

<p>"<i>P.S.</i>&mdash;If you now any other frends as
wood like to cum, bring em."</p>

<p>When the laughter that had followed the
reading of this epistle had somewhat subsided
William said to his sister: "Now, Kitty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
what do you think of that invitation? my
word! but we are going to have a gay time
of it up here; parties will be going the round
of the country after this. Of course, you
will go to the Sawyers rejoicings, Kitty, and
put on your pretty, and good behaviour?"</p>

<p>"If I had not known you were joking, Will,
I would be angry with you," exclaimed the
indignant girl. "The impertinence of the
horrid creatures indeed!"</p>

<p>"But you know, Kate, 'I dosent drink,' as
the prospective Mrs. Jones affirms; consequently
there is no fear of you, unless you
too often drink to the health of the happy
couple."</p>

<p>"Don't talk nonsense, Will, but tell us how
this affair has come about; it is the first I
have heard of a marriage in their family being
contemplated?" said Kate.</p>

<p>"Well, my little poppet," said William, "I
will impart to you all the information I have
been able to glean, and which has been
obtained from Mr. Reuben Sawyer, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
brother of the bride, and the bearer of the
note of invitation. It appears that a certain
gentleman rejoicing in the name of Jones,
and honoured by the prefixed title of Captain
(though from whence, or in what service I
know not), has by some means introduced
himself to the family of Sawyer, and made a
conquest of the heart of the younger female
member. They are to be married at Alma on
Sunday, thence to return to the hall of the
bride's father, and entertain their friends on
Monday. What the pecuniary arrangements
are, I don't know; but I strongly suspect
they are to the advantage of the <i>soi-disant</i>
Captain, of whom, by the bye, I imagine the
Sawyer family know very little. It strikes
me it will turn out a sell for the girl, for I
fully expect the bridegroom will be discovered
to be an impostor. I am convinced he has
assumed a title and garb to palm himself off
on them as a gentleman, while they have
snatched at the bait."</p>

<p>"What a dreadful man he must be then,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
said Kate.</p>

<p>"Even so, Miss Kate," said Tom; "but
there are numbers of such 'dreadful men'
prowling about in the colony; who appropriate
and abandon as many aliases and
personate as many characters as would people
a small town. They have a convenient knack
of falling in love with such girls as Miss Mary
Ann Sawyer, to whom they give a glowing
account of all their wealthy friends and genteel
relations. Then before the effect dies
out they propose, are accepted, recommend
a speedy marriage to prevent, as they say,
their relations from hearing and stopping the
intended match, and induce, too frequently,
not only the girl, but her friends to fall into
their views; while they do not discover their
error until the gay Lothario takes leg-bail
upon the first symptoms of an enquiry being
made after him by the victim of some
previous matrimonial swindle."</p>

<p>"Well," said William, "I am inclined to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
accept the invitation for myself. I would
like to witness the fun, for fun I am sure
there will be; and I am authorised to invite
any friends, so will make use of my <i>carte
blanche</i> and ask you, Tom. What do you
say, will you go? If you will, we will go
together. I would like to see their spread,
and attempts at doing the genteel thing;
but, at the same time, I should like to have
some one to accompany me."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't mind it at all," said Tom, "I'll
join you with pleasure to witness the feast.
I expect it will be a rich sight, if not a rich
feed. Will you make one of us, John?"</p>

<p>"No," replied John, "I could not endure
their disgusting affectation; and I would find
no pleasure in witnessing their gross fooleries.
I will remain at home, and take care of Kate;
she will want some one to keep her company,
while you two roisterers are absent; and I
am sure it will be more congenial to both
of us."</p>

<p>"Yes, it will indeed," said Kate; "I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
glad you don't think of leaving me all alone,
John, and going to visit those horrid people."</p>

<p>"Well, we will make amends by giving
you a graphic description of it when we
return," said William; "and, unless I am very
much mistaken, it will be of such a nature as
will excite your risibility."</p>

<p>"Very well then," replied Kate, "I hope it
will be funny; but whatever you do, Will,
pray don't give any of the creatures any
encouragement to come here, for I am sure
I could not bear the sight of them in our
house."</p>

<p>"Never fear, <i>ma cher</i>," replied William,
"our little tutelary angel shall never be contaminated
by the intercourse of our plebeian
neighbours; who must learn to consider,
notwithstanding an officer has married into
their family, that they are only entitled to gaze
at our bright star, and that it is too much
felicity to expect permission to be graced by
an admission within the circle of its rays."</p>

<p>"Don't talk any more nonsense, Will,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
replied his sister, "but be sure, if any of those
people make any proposition to come here,
that you will use all your endeavours to prevent
them."</p>

<p>On the following Monday, towards the
evening, Tom Rainsfield and William mounted
their horses at Fern Vale, to ride over to the
domicile of the Sawyers. They had delayed
their visit until the close of the day, presuming,
though their invitation specified no
time of meeting, that they would be quite
early enough at the hour they were going.
They therefore rode leisurely along, and approached
"Industry" (as the Sawyers had
christened their place) just as the sun was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
sinking in the west. The scene that then
presented itself to their vision was truly of a
novel character, and one that rather amused
them.</p>

<p>A short distance from the cottage had been
erected a bowery hall for the reception and
feasting of the guests; and at the time when
it first burst upon their view the shouts that
arose from its umbrageous walls plainly indicated
the nature of the proceedings within.
But as the reader is not supposed to be
possessed of the same ubiquitous faculties as
the author, we may be permitted, for the
purpose of enlightenment, to describe the
nature of those proceedings.</p>

<p>In the interior of this retreat, and stretching
its entire length, was a bench or impromptu
table, with seats on each side of it of a similar
construction; in the whole of which the
rough material was plentifully and principally
called into use. On the board stood the remains
of sundry viands, proclaiming the conclusion
of a feast; and bottles, and drinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
utensils of various shapes, sizes, and material,
were kept in constant activity by numerous
grim-visaged masculine beings who sat round
the table. The variety of costumes was
particularly striking, from the perfect black,
donned for the nonce by the head of the
Sawyer family, to that of one of his choicest
friends, who sat in resplendent vest, and shirt
sleeves; having divested himself of his outer
garment on the principle of preference to ease
over elegance. In the rear of what we may
call the saloon, in the shade of the bush,
another party was assembled; and from the
shrieks of the women, and the boisterous
mirth of the men, it was evident their amusement
was something other than that of a
passive nature.</p>

<p>As our friends approached this group a
fleet-footed female darted from the human
labyrinth like a startled fawn closely pursued
by one of the merry-making lords of the
creation. The chase was continued amidst
the repetition of a perfect Babel of shouts and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
laughter, until the panting and exhausted roe
sank into the arms of the pursuing hart, and
yielded to the requiting inosculation. Blush
not, gentle reader; these matured specimens
of the family of man, for the time forgot the
dignity of their years, and were amusing
themselves by a renewal of their youthful
pristine enjoyments. They were in fact playing
at "kiss in the ring."</p>

<p>In the rear of the house the young men
detected another foliate shed, in which were,
secured to some rough stalls, numerous specimens
of horse-flesh; while in the vicinity
were scattered drays, light spring carts, and
even shakey gigs, evidently the conveyances
of the various guests. Here our friends left
their horses; and judging the best place to
present themselves to their host, and where
they were most likely to see him, would be
the leafy hall, they bent thither their steps.
Upon reaching the entrance they perceived
the company was being enlivened by the performance
of some disciple of Apollo, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
venting forth in a stentorian voice a rendering
of "The Maniac;" and when he uttered (as the
young men arrested their steps so as not to
"disturb the harmony"): "No, by heavens!
I am not mad," they really thought he was
under the same strange hallucination as the
subject of the song, and labouring to deceive
himself upon a reality. If he was not mad,
they imagined, he was at least bordering on
that state; while the whole of his hearers
were not far removed from the same, when
they tolerated such uproar unworthily dignified
by the name of music.</p>

<p>However, when the song ceased, in the
midst of the deafening shouts, and clatter of
tumblers etc. that followed, William and his
companion entered; and at once distinguished
the late singer as the individual who sat at
the head of the board. This personage was a
coarse-looking, red-faced, thick-set fellow;
with lowering eyebrows, bushy moustache
(though otherwise cleanly shaved face), and
hair of an objectionable, though undefinable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
colour. He was dressed, as far as was perceptible,
in a black coat, white waistcoat, and
neckerchief, and with an immense frill front
to his shirt. He seemed to be exceedingly
heated with the exertion of his song; and was
drying his face and forehead with a white
handkerchief, in which action he was displaying
more than one massive ring; adorning fingers,
that, to the eyes of our friends, proved experience
in more active and manual employment
than military discipline would be likely to
require. He sat smiling complacently at his
friends, as one who was conscious of having
displayed the possession of a valuable talent;
and, though gratified by the adulation of his
hearers, he took it as a just homage, and as a
proof that they were not destitute of a phrygian
taste; or at least could appreciate music,
when they heard it in perfection, as when he
himself sang.</p>

<p>This individual, our friends rightly judged,
was Captain Jones. On his right sat his lady,
the quondam Miss Sawyer, and on his left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
her worthy papa. Whether the young lady
was enchanted by the lyric strains of her lord,
or not, we are at a loss to say; notwithstanding
that we know she was possessed of what
she called a "pihanner," and had a soul for
music, having on various occasions accompanied
herself on that instrument to the immense
delight of her admiring friends. She
might have been actuated in her lengthened
sitting by motives of a protective character,
to preserve her husband from a too free libation;
or, it might have been, that she felt
happy in no other society but his. Either of
which reasons were sufficiently cogent, though
we are unable to conjecture which might have
influenced her. But, be it as it may, there
she sat; and, with the exception of her mother,
who occupied the foot of the table, she was
the only representative of her sex in the
assembly.</p>

<p>William and Tom had made their way very
nearly up to the head of the table before they
were noticed by the host; who, when he perceived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
them, jumped from his seat, and seizing
them each by the hand, expressed all sorts of
pleasure at their presence, and formally introduced
them to the bold Captain Jones and his
lady. The latter having received their congratulations
with the most perfect nonchalance,
proposed, as the evening was drawing
on, that the company should all adjourn
to the house; and suiting her motion to her
word she sallied from the bower, escorted by
our friends, and followed by the bridegroom,
and the other "beings of sterner stuff."</p>

<p>In the cottage they were joined by those
who had been amusing themselves on the
green; and all then sat down to another substantial
meal that went by the name of tea.
This being despatched, while the rooms were
being cleared, the men adjourned to the
verandah and grass to smoke, and were joined
by some of the women; while the rest assisted
in the domestic arrangements inside. These
being completed, and the smokers satisfied
with "blowing their cloud," they reentered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
the dwelling, which had in the short
space of time they had occupied in the enjoyment
of the narcotic weed, become perfectly
metamorphosed. The principal room had
been converted from <i>la salle á manger</i> to <i>la
salle de danse</i>; and its transition had been so
speedily effected that the company were quite
delighted, and loud in their praises of the
effective adornment We are inclined to
think, however, more was to be attributed
to the spirit that pervaded the company to
be pleased with everything than that there
was any display of wonderful taste. A few
boughs of green foliage were stuck about the
walls; and the benches of planks were arranged
all round the room, and covered with
scarlet blankets; while, by way of chandeliers,
and in lieu of candlesticks, bottles, containing
"Belmont sperms," were dispersed and
stationed on every available stand, by which
simple means the lighting and decorating of
the hall was completed.</p>

<p>The superior guests (we mean our young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
friends William and Tom) were led away by
"the Captain," who acted as major domo
<span class="smcap">M.C.</span>, etc., to a back room; which on ordinary
occasions served as the dormitory of Mr.
Reuben Sawyer, but on the present was set
apart for the especial refreshment of "the
gents;" while the bridal apartment in the
front was made to endure a similar profanation
for the benefit of "the ladies." The
Captain, after enjoying another shake of the
hand from his visitors, gave vent to his feelings
in a rapturous expression of delight at
the honour of their patronage; declaring
the moment to be the happiest of his life;
trusting he should long enjoy the pleasure of
their friendship; regretting that their friends
had not found it convenient to accompany
them; and finally requested them to join him
in a drink. Upon receiving an acquiescence
to this request, he exclaimed: "What shall it
be? Brandy? gin? wine? claret? champagne?
Ah, champagne; yes! we will have
a bottle of champagne for good fellowship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
sake." Upon which he took up a bottle and
cut the string, when away flew the cork, while
he poured the wine into three tumblers. Two
of these he pushed over to his guests, while
the third he raised to his own lips, with the
trite though universal toast of "here's luck,"
and drained his glass at a draught; while he
smacked his lips with the air of a connoisseur,
and said: "You'll find that an excellent wine,
for I selected it myself. The fellow I bought
it from tried to palm some inferior stuff on to
me, but it wouldn't do; he did not know I
was a judge of wine until I convinced him I
was not to be humbugged by any of his
rubbish. But to tell you the truth wine is
all stuff; it does not do a man any good;
it may suit a Frenchman (who has got no
blood in him) to drink it; but give me beer
or brandy they are the drinks for an Englishman.
What'll keep life in a fellow like
brandy? the only right thing the French
ever did was to make brandy; it's the real
stuff to cheer you after all. Try a 'ball,'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
will you?"</p>

<p>Both William and Tom thanked the enthusiastic
Captain, but declined the proffered
ball; while he assisted himself to a pretty
stiff jorum of the <i>eau de vie</i>, and quaffed it as
if it was a really necessary concomitant to
his life; after which he said: "Well, suppose
then we go into the room to the women; they
will be wanting me to start them off in a
dance. But have a smoke? here's some cigars
if you like them. You know we don't object
to smoking in our drawing-room, ah! ah!
ah! This is Liberty Hall! for you can do
as you like. But excuse me, I must be off;
make yourselves perfectly at home." Saying
which, and puffing vigorously at a cigar, he
left them, while they leisurely sauntered into
the verandah in front; from which they could
witness the terpsichorean arrangements.</p>

<p>Elevated in a remote corner of the room,
was a professional gentleman of the Paganini
school; but, unlike that great performer, he
was not content to manipulate upon one chord,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
but continued with strenuous efforts to raise
discord on four. His music, if not exactly
metrical, was at least spirited, and that was
sufficient for the lovers of the "light fantastic,"
who danced "their allotted hour" with no
small degree of delight. As all human happiness
must have an end so had the enjoyment
of these merrymakers; and the jig was
terminated in a long drawn sigh, and "Oh!
dear me," from the women, and an explosion
of the remaining pent-up steam of the men.
These forthwith adjourned "to liquor," leaving
the softer sex to do the same if they felt so
disposed, which many of them appeared to be.
After about half an hour had elapsed, when
the guests returned by degrees to the saloon,
Captain Jones volunteered a song; and, upon
obtaining the greatest degree of silence practicable,
gave the "Ship on Fire." It was in
much the same style as the former specimen
of his vocalic talent; except that he was a
little more boisterous, and sang with a less
distinct utterance. But still he was in keeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
with the character of the epic; for, unless
his face very much belied his internal state,
he was in one intestine blaze. There is an
oft repeated story of Sir Walter Raleigh that
while he was one day smoking his wonted
pipe his servant brought him in his beer;
but when the domestic, uninitiated to the
consolation of the weed, beheld a volume of
smoke emitted from the mouth of his master
he imagined him to be inflicted by a celiac
conflagration, and cast the contents of the
flagon into Sir Walter's face. If the ingenious
servitor had only lived in our day, and
been called upon to wait on our friend the
Captain as he appeared on this occasion, he
would assuredly have made the same waste
of malt liquor on the illuminated visage of
that individual. However, the "Ship on Fire"
was got through, and elicited great applause;
after which, the <i>artiste</i>, perceiving his genteel
guests rather apart from the rest of the company,
and not joining in the festivities, came
over and addressed them in the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
words:</p>

<p>"Why don't you make yourself at home?
you haven't had anything to drink to-night;
some refreshments will be round in a minute
or so, and then we will have a dance; but
you've never heard my wife sing, have you?"
Upon receiving a reply in the negative, he
continued: "Then, my word, she's a stunner!
I'll go and tell her you want her to sing. You
know she sings, 'I should like to marry.' I
composed a song for her to that tune, and you
shall hear it;" saying which he left them to
induce his fair bride to oblige her friends; at
the same time that Mr. Sawyer, junior, made
his appearance with a large jug and a number
of tumblers, and asked our friends if they
would take a drink. They thought it strange
to bring water round to imbibe, considering
that most of the guests ignored that beverage
without its being plentifully diluted with
spirits (as the Captain said). But thinking it
was possibly on their account, seeing that
they did not indulge alcoholically as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
others did, our young friends gladly accepted
a glass, and held it to be filled from the jug.
To their astonishment, however, what they
had imagined was water gave evidence, by its
appearance, of more inebriating qualities.</p>

<p>"Why, what on earth is that you're giving
us, Reuben?" asked William.</p>

<p>"Champagne," replied the youth.</p>

<p>"Champagne!" they both uttered at once;
"that is a novel way of serving champagne."</p>

<p>"Oh, father said it was humbug to open a
bottle and hand it round in mouthfuls to the
people," replied the youth; "so, you see we
opened a lot, and turned them into this jug,
so that everybody can take a drink of it."</p>

<p>This idea considerably amused our friends,
and they laughed heartily at the champagne
service, as they called it; but were checked
suddenly in their mirth by the "charming
and accomplished" Mrs. Jones warbling forth
her desires for a suitable match in the matrimonial
way. We need not repeat her song
but merely state that her desiderata were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
centred in a young digger with plenty of
gold, and a good hut, which was to be
possessed of a brick chimney; and not a slab
"humpie" with a hole in the bark roof, containing
a tub or other cylindrical vessel to
carry off the smoke. And the desired one,
should he present himself, was to go down on
his knees, and conscientiously swear that he
"had left no wife at home." When the lady
had finished her song the plaudits of her
enraptured hearers rang through the house,
and the woods outside. The company were
enchanted, and no doubt imagined she had
far surpassed even the efforts of a Grisi (did
they but know such a being existed). The
fair creature herself was equally satisfied with
her performance, which she considered exquisite;
though our friends were rude enough to
think otherwise, notwithstanding that they
were profuse in their praise to the lady and
her husband. Dancing was then resumed,
and the young men, having seen enough to
afford a fund of amusement to themselves and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
their respective family circles, waited for an
opportunity to slip away unmolested. The
fortuitous event was not long in presenting
itself; and at a moment when the majority
of the men were engaged "fast and furious"
at their wassail, the two young men saddled
their horses, mounted, and returned to Fern
Vale.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
